Dad realized something was wrong that night and we talked. The next day he took a day off work and when my sister and I went to school they had it out and dad kicked mom out of the house. The whole thing rocked my sister. She wanted to know what happened and why we couldn't be a family anymore. Mom moved in with the affair partner. My sister couldn't figure out why I hated mom. Mom insisted we come see her new house and I refused to talk until all the anger boiled over and I told her that I hated her, that I never wanted to see her cheating face again. She told me she was my mom and that I couldn't stay mad at her. I told her she was dead to me. That cheating was one thing, but to try and force me to stay silent, to try and make me keep her nasty secrets. I told her she was nasty, disgusting, that I didn't want to look at her. I was so mad. Mom did sort of admit to multiple affairs when she tried to use the \"I was always a good mom line\" and admitted to being distracted by others at times instead of being a mom to us.\n\nMy sister and I ended up with a strained relationship because I refused to have a relationship with mom for her and she refused to accept that what mom did had involved me, the second she told me to lie for her and even when she wasn't a good mom to us being distracted by other guys.\n\nI haven't seen my mom in 12 years. My sister and I see and talk to each other, but it's like distant cousins who see each other once every few years and not siblings.\n\nNeither were at my wedding. I didn't invite mom. My sister wouldn't come because I told her she couldn't bring mom.\n\nIt bothers my ILs and they wanted me to reconcile so my son could have a healthy and whole family. They tried to claim that 12 years was long enough to leave the past where it is. Mina, my wife, added that she'd like our son to be around his grandmother and to not grow up seeing his dad hate her. Or at the very least for my sister and I to be as close as we once were. I told her we'd talk about it later and I told her family that it was not something that and I needed to talk about.

Could you get him to chat to the in-laws?", "NTA\nIt's not their place to dictate to you your interpersonal relationships. It's news to no one how you feel about your mother having been excluded from your life (and wedding) for your entire relationship to your wife. \n\nYour wife needs to stop listening to her parents whispers in her ears and support you.", "NTA. They are being very intrusive. This is entirely up to you.\n\n>They tried to claim that 12 years was long enough to leave the past where it is.\n\nIt is - your mother is in the past, and is neither a part of your present nor your future. This harassment and interference needs to stop.", "NTA. It's none of their business, and they don't get to tell you how much time is long enough or that you should forgive. Only you can decide if and/or when you're ready. What is rude is them interfering in your relationships. If they don't like how you reacted to it, too bad. They shouldn't have raised it.\n\nYour mother was having affairs whilst you were still a child. 16 is also still a child. She tried to manipulate a child to lie on her behalf because she was too self-absorbed to put you first. She neglected your needs because she was too selfish to put you first. She caused a great deal of damage and a great deal of pain.\n\nHer history of putting her needs above her own children should make it clear enough as to why she's not welcome.

Put your foot down hard, or they'll keep crossing your boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nIf the in-laws were advocating you work through your anger because they think it would benefit all, that would be one thing.

Then the two of you, as a united front can sit the in-laws down and say hey, we appreciate your concern. I wish my mother was different, but she's not.

I don\u2019t think a child who\u2019s been in this world for about 72 hours really gives a flying fuck about a grandma. They\u2019ve got one and that\u2019s enough. If your child was 16 and asking then yes, I think it would be reasonable to explain the situation, but they\u2019re not. \n\nYour wife is also having questionable behaviour. I\u2019m not one to just say \u201cDIVORCE\u201d but I do believe you two need to talk and for you to communicate and express your concerns and feelings about this whole situation.

That's pretty awful.\n\nFwiw- My mother did something similar except I was an adult at the time, and it was still pretty traumatic.

If you approach it from an angle of wanting to keep a positive relationship with them and finding it hard when they won't stop bringing it up, they might back off a bit.\n\nI think you need to have a long talk with your partner, because prolonged pressure like this can easily turn to resentment between you two and your partner needs to be aware they're pushing for a problematic outcome.", "Nta", "NTA. When you and your wife talk, remind her that because she has a healthy relationship with her parents, it may be difficult to understand you do not.  That is okay.

I understand what they want but that doesn't mean it has to happen. This is your child too and your mother tried to emotionally manipulate her own child after being what was basically an absentee parent beforehand. Why would you want someone like that around your child? Has she ever even tried to apologise or admit to her mistake?????? Doesn't sound like she did anything more than make excuses.\n\nMight be time to maybe sit down and talk to the sister though. For you. Because holding all that toxic emotion inside isn't healthy. Consider therapy. Not so you can reconcile with your mother or anything but so you can deal with how you feel and move forward and be happy and healthy and whole for your children. \n\nI hope you can heal from this trauma.", "NTA at all.\n\nYour mom, after everything she has done to you and put you through, does not deserve to know her grandson. Her being your mother does not entitle her to be a grandmother. Grandparent rights are earned. After the way she treated you and what she put you through, I wouldn't blame you if you never spoke to her again. I can't fathom asking my own child to cover up my cheating for me; and even more baffling is that she admitted to cheating multiple times. You are right. It is disgusting behaviour.\n\nAs for your sister, she needs to wake the hell up and realize that the sun doesn't shine out of your mom's ass. The situation that happened absolutely involved you; it must have been awful to walk in on what you walked in on. For her to completely disregard that and act like you're in the wrong is so ridiculous and stupid. Your mom's decisions are what broke your family apart, and your sister's rose coloured glasses are so thick that she can't see the red flags blatantly waving in front of her face.\n\nAs for the ILs, they need to mind their own business. They did not have to deal with the trauma you went through as a result of your mother's actions and the hurt you have felt due to your relationship with your sister. They don't have a right to dictate who you do and don't have relationships with, and you absolutely have a right to protect your mental and emotional health by distancing yourself from toxic family members. You also have a right to protect your son from toxic family members. Your feelings are the only ones that matter in this situation, and your wife should really be backing you up on this, especially if she knows the history.", "NTA \n\nI am sorry you went through that OP. \n\nFirst, you need to tell Mira that nothing has changed.

They need to see it like this. Why they want you to be uncomfortable? \n\nGood luck Op!", "NTA", "Are you the same OP that posted a while ago about being mad at his wife for talking to your sister behind your back and even threatening with divorce if she didn\u2019t stop?

I\u2019m NC with my parents (abusive situation). My MiL is INCAPABLE of grasping my situation and has hounded me on multiple occasions to forgive my parents, going so far as to claim I was never abused, I\u2019m just a selfish brat like all teenagers who can\u2019t understand how difficult parents have it. \n\nKnow what my husband does?

Why do they think they aren\u2019t enough? Are they trying to tell you they want to share the role or feel too much is expected as the only grandparents (you haven\u2019t mentioned your dad aka grandpa - do they?). \n\nEither way, they are putting their opinions about what a \u201cproper\u201d family is above your wishes, historical precedent and they are trying to force some *they don\u2019t actually know* onto their own grandchildren.
