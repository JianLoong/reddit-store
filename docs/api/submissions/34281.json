That sounds incredibly frustrating and a real AH move from your mom. My only hope is that they are actually planning to get you it in the future, otherwise why would they buy you the stuff??

Ever since then I've been getting shit on for being a drop despite me never wanting that. \n\nOne of the worst examples of parenting possible.", "It seems like some information went missing during your move. Your mother withdrew you from school, a few months before graduation, but somehow never enrolled you in the local high school in your new state. And now she and your grandmother are treating you as \"less than\" because you didn't graduate high school the normal way, even though that was through her doing, not yours. \n\nThe only explanation I can think of, that makes sense, is that your mother expected you to enroll yourself in high school in your new state without her help. That would be tough as usually a parent has to sign the forms, and I generally wouldn't expect a 17 year old to know how to register themselves for school, nor to have the organization to do it without help (or with opposition, which it sounds like your mom is funny that way) but maybe it would have been possible for you to do it. It's hard to say. Regardless, it would have been difficult, because there would be a gap in your schooling due to getting your old transcript, enrolling in the correct new classes, finding out what your teachers want from you, and any disjointedness between the curricula in your old school and your new one. As a parent, I would say that your mom moving you from state to state, months before your graduation, was an AH move. Blaming the outcome on you, was even worse. I'm sorry you have had to deal with that. \n\nThis new thing of making you a checklist seems demeaning but I suppose the other way you could look at it is that you probably DO need to check off some things before you're ready to become independent of your mom. Your grandmother pulled a bait and switch on you but at least you got your GED out of it. What can you do next? How rural are you? You are 20 now, that means you don't have to continue living with your mom. Obviously a huge thing for you will be that you are very rural and that you have no funds to rent an apartment in a more populated area where you could get a job. But maybe there's something else you can do to move things ahead for yourself. What were your grades like in high school? Can you do online college? Sometimes there are state funding agencies for things like students in difficult circumstances. Also, is there any public transport at all? Like even if you had to walk an hour to a bus stop, if you did it and could work at a fast food place, you'd at least be earning a little bit and getting out of this place of feeling helpless over your fate. \n\nWhen you say your mom won't let you drive, what do you mean? She won't lend you her car? She won't pay for you to take driving lessons? You're a legal adult, so \"won't let me\" needs to be clarified here.\n\nEven if you're stuck at home, there are still things you can do to prepare yourself so that when an opportunity DOES come to you, you are able to grab it and make use of it. You can learn to cook on a budget. Find out the prices of things with online grocery information (e.g. Acme and Giant both have websites that give the current prices of foods). Look up some inexpensive, nutritious recipes (a bean and a grain make a complete protein source to an easy place to start is rice and beans with cilantro and lime, that gets you a little leafy greens and some vitamin C too). Offer to cook for your mom and try out the recipes. Learn about nutrition. Learn about budgeting. Learn how to clean the house. Design a filing system for your important papers. Find out how to get a passport. The more you know, the more you can do. Did you know some universities have free online courses? It won't be quite like going to college but it will stimulate your brain and some of the material will actually be useful to your life, like biology 101 will help you learn about your body and manage your own health. \n\nYou can do this! \n\nNTA.", "You're being abused. You're old enough to work. But your mother won't let you work AND she sabotaged your education. They want you to be completely dependent on you so they can control you.

NTA but you need to look for a room to rent and a job.", "NTA\n\nWrite your own checklist with all the things you need to do to remove yourself from this situation.\n\nKeep the other one next to it in case you lack motivation.

I guess Some silver linings come from emotional abuse haha", "I've had trust issues for so long, I've been cheated on in every relationship and my parents have cheated me out of every damn thing I've worked towards. But I've always subscribed to the belief that not all people are the same and not to let past actions of other people dictate how I act towards new people.

You can replace it in the future.\n\nBut right now you need to plan your exit.", "I'm so curious where your grandma is spending that on tooth extraction and dentures. Mine cost about 10k for basic dentures. Someone else I know did top of the line full implants post full extration and that was still only 25k. For reference I live in a high cost of living city and had no insurance so that is the full out of pocket price. Someone is playing you here I think.", "im worried she will leave you toothless as another method of control", "I wouldn't count on the dentures from their side. Like the other promises they didn't keep.   \nWhat if you let extract all your teeth and then your mum and grandma refuse to pay for dentures?  \nI would rather find any job myself first, than letting them do this for you.   \nBTW - your bad teeth - is it your fault? Couldn't the problem were adressed  and solved earlier?", "My guy they\u2019re lying to you big time!! Being in the miltary and the jobs I\u2019ve been in I\u2019ve seen some gnarly teeth and still work there. I\u2019ve worked with ppl with really bad breath to where you think they ate garbage or some sort of corpse. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest your post triggered me a lot cuz it makes me think of my husband\u2019s situation prior us married. Take what you need and play it safe with what you take cuz you\u2019ll be accused of stealing stuff that was given to you. My husband planned very carefully and felt very safe with me cuz I was his ticket in helping him. So I hope you have friends or another relative helping you. For my husband he left in the middle of the night cuz he knew how his mom was and left his old cell phone behind.

Like is this something that is clear to you that you have been told by a dentist personally? Or is it all your mom and grandma telling you that you need all your teeth pulled? Is there definitely, objectively no alternative to that? Also if you actually do need those teeth pulled, how sure are you that your grandma will come through on the dentures? Is there any chance she would refuse to pay and leave you stuck in a condition that would make it harder for you to leave or get a job?\n\nGypsy Rose\u2019s mother had all her teeth pulled to make her look sicker/more disabled and keep her dependent even though she did not really need them pulled.", "I\u2019ve dealt with a parent who was a narcissist. First of all, I hope she follows through on the dental promise. Secondly, just be aware that anything these people do for you, even if they say it\u2019s a gift or for your benefit, they will absolutely bring it up later to make you feel guilty and indebted forever. \u201cLook at everything I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d People who love you don\u2019t use gifts as a manipulation tactic.

That NC was a better state for keeping control over her soon to be adult child.", "I go to the dentist a lot - I had a convo with one of the hygienists about autoimmune disease. She said her mom\u2019s lupus had inflamed her gums and destroyed a lot of her teeth, so eventually they made the decision to pull all of her teeth and get dentures. She said that leaving a few teeth often causes a lot of problems, and implants can be an expensive nightmare. OP was maybe not taken to the dentist as a kid, because it sounds like he was neglected. That said, the possibility of medical abuse shouldn\u2019t be ruled out.", "Read other OP's comments and posts, so you'll know, why his mother would keeping control on him.", "Yeah, it\u2019s definitely possible he needs it but he should have a dentist tell him that directly.
