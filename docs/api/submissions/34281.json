That sounds incredibly frustrating and a real AH move from your mom. My only hope is that they are actually planning to get you it in the future, otherwise why would they buy you the stuff?? Still doesn\u2019t excuse the deception and broken trust. But maybe you will have a silver lining.

Ever since then I've been getting shit on for being a drop despite me never wanting that. \n\nOne of the worst examples of parenting possible.", "It seems like some information went missing during your move. Your mother withdrew you from school, a few months before graduation, but somehow never enrolled you in the local high school in your new state. And now she and your grandmother are treating you as \"less than\" because you didn't graduate high school the normal way, even though that was through her doing, not yours. \n\nThe only explanation I can think of, that makes sense, is that your mother expected you to enroll yourself in high school in your new state without her help. That would be tough as usually a parent has to sign the forms, and I generally wouldn't expect a 17 year old to know how to register themselves for school, nor to have the organization to do it without help (or with opposition, which it sounds like your mom is funny that way) but maybe it would have been possible for you to do it. It's hard to say. Regardless, it would have been difficult, because there would be a gap in your schooling due to getting your old transcript, enrolling in the correct new classes, finding out what your teachers want from you, and any disjointedness between the curricula in your old school and your new one. As a parent, I would say that your mom moving you from state to state, months before your graduation, was an AH move. Blaming the outcome on you, was even worse. I'm sorry you have had to deal with that. \n\nThis new thing of making you a checklist seems demeaning but I suppose the other way you could look at it is that you probably DO need to check off some things before you're ready to become independent of your mom. Your grandmother pulled a bait and switch on you but at least you got your GED out of it. What can you do next? How rural are you? You are 20 now, that means you don't have to continue living with your mom. Obviously a huge thing for you will be that you are very rural and that you have no funds to rent an apartment in a more populated area where you could get a job. But maybe there's something else you can do to move things ahead for yourself. What were your grades like in high school? Can you do online college? Sometimes there are state funding agencies for things like students in difficult circumstances. Also, is there any public transport at all? Like even if you had to walk an hour to a bus stop, if you did it and could work at a fast food place, you'd at least be earning a little bit and getting out of this place of feeling helpless over your fate. \n\nWhen you say your mom won't let you drive, what do you mean? She won't lend you her car? She won't pay for you to take driving lessons? You're a legal adult, so \"won't let me\" needs to be clarified here.\n\nEven if you're stuck at home, there are still things you can do to prepare yourself so that when an opportunity DOES come to you, you are able to grab it and make use of it. You can learn to cook on a budget. Find out the prices of things with online grocery information (e.g. Acme and Giant both have websites that give the current prices of foods). Look up some inexpensive, nutritious recipes (a bean and a grain make a complete protein source to an easy place to start is rice and beans with cilantro and lime, that gets you a little leafy greens and some vitamin C too). Offer to cook for your mom and try out the recipes. Learn about nutrition. Learn about budgeting. Learn how to clean the house. Design a filing system for your important papers. Find out how to get a passport. The more you know, the more you can do. Did you know some universities have free online courses? It won't be quite like going to college but it will stimulate your brain and some of the material will actually be useful to your life, like biology 101 will help you learn about your body and manage your own health. \n\nYou can do this! \n\nNTA.", "You're being abused. You're old enough to work. But your mother won't let you work AND she sabotaged your education. They want you to be completely dependent on you so they can control you. I bet even if you get a job they'll demand most or all your money. Don't give it to them. NTA but you need to look for a room to rent and a job.", "NTA\n\nWrite your own checklist with all the things you need to do to remove yourself from this situation.\n\nKeep the other one next to it in case you lack motivation. It might help you after all but just not the way your grandma had intended.", "You are a 20 year old ADULT. I think the reason your mom moved you to a remote area BEFORE you turned 18 (adult age) is so she could continue to control you. Do you have other family besides Grandma?

Tell them your mom is keeping you hostage (which is what she is doing since she didn't re-enroll you in school in Carolina, is preventing you from learning to drive and get a job).

But my grandma is willing my spend $45k American btw, for surgery. But cant get me a christmas presents. Because the ones I did get were from my mom.

I worded it poorly.", "I agree their intentions were good, there's no doubt there. But it damages trust heavily as well ws sets a precedent when you do that to your kid", "I also I want to add to this that a few posts above OP comments that grandma is paying $45,000 for them for surgery and new teeth because theirs are so bad, and also a few comments below OP mentions that they have a huge panic disorder; I just feel like we are either getting one side of the story or missing a whole lot of information - or both.", "My dream guitar is EBMM John Petrucci Majesty 6\n\nBut the one I want thats actually realistic is this LTD Arctic Arrow someone is willing to sell me for 400.

So she dropped me out then wouldnt let me go back to school. My mom is complete asshole. When I first met my current girlfriend on our very first date ever my mom called me for some extremely innocuous reason, and my mom yelled at me saying the most disgusting heinous things you could say for an hour straight and my immediate thought was that the date was ruined and this girl would never talk to me again, but my girlfriend heard everything and literally cried and hugged me because of what she heard my mom say,  it only made our relationship stronger. I guess Some silver linings come from emotional abuse haha", "I've had trust issues for so long, I've been cheated on in every relationship and my parents have cheated me out of every damn thing I've worked towards. But I've always subscribed to the belief that not all people are the same and not to let past actions of other people dictate how I act towards new people. I'm always nice and giving and thoughtful until I'm given a reason not to be. It usually leads to me being taken advantage of but sometimes not", "Yeah, but once you were in NC you could still finish school there.", "OMG! I understand teeth problems! I have to get three root canals and all four of my wisdom teeth removed.. They are willing to pay that much money but not willing to let you get a job. If an employer needs people badly, they will hire regardless of looks  as most states and companies have policies in place where you CAN'T discriminate due to certain physical aspects.

I understand you\u2019re upset because you didn\u2019t get a Christmas present, but if you had to pay for dental surgery yourself how would you even attempt to do that? if they are so bad that you need them all extracted, it will absolutely (if it hasn\u2019t already) affect your health, never mind your job prospects. I know you\u2019re disappointed, but your teeth are so much more of a priority than a guitar.", "Its just my mom, my grandma, and my dad. None of those are options.
