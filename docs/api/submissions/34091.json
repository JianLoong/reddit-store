All you did was cause a scene and make that family feel even worse than they already did, and for what reason? The situation was already finished and they had handled it the best way they could.", "YTA. How old is your daughter? I wouldn't have liked it either, and definitely would have taken away the candy, but the time to protect your daughter was before the woman got hold of her. Not pitching a fit after it was all over with. It was too late then and served no purpose but to upset everyone involved."]}
