{"id": 31333, "submission_id": "17zig9u", "title": "AITA for refusing to get in the tub after my husband stood in it with his outside flip flops?", "selftext": "My husband and I are on a trip at a b&b with a claw foot tub. \n\nI am a very clean person, and generally paranoid about cleanliness standards of hotels. So I\u2019ve sort of \u201ctrained\u201d my husband to wear flip flops in hotels vs bare feet. We also wear flip flops into showers, or tubs that we don\u2019t plan to bathe in. But apparently he thinks this applies to a tub we are about to bathe in as well. \n\nTonight, we decided to bathe in the tub. He was about to use soap to wash the tub before the soak but I noticed he\u2019d worn his flip flops to shower in the tub. These flip flops have been out on the streets. The amount of germs and trash they brought made me 100% sure I wouldn\u2019t be taking a bath there. \n\nBut he got upset at me instead - according to him, I\u2019m making up new rules. I don\u2019t think I did because this is implied... It blows my mind that he thinks differently - am I AH for thinking this? \n\nI think he should apologize for ruining a relaxing bath. He won\u2019t because he feels that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and blames me for changing rules. \n\nSo AITAH?\n\n1st Edit to add: \nThank you all for your judgment. I\u2019m seeing a consensus that I\u2019m TA. Reasons: my \u201clogic\u201d for cleaning practices is unclear; my germaphobia would be improved if I actually learned how they work and how they impact the body; I should react more productively to my husband\u2019s \u201cmistakes\u201d when accommodating my special standards.  \n\nI also saw multiple messages to \u201cget therapy\u201d, I don\u2019t think I need it. 1) It\u2019s really not impacting my life or my husband\u2019s life that much, no need to extrapolate our life from this one incident, 2) I know I need to chill about germs and cleanliness. I\u2019m going to talk to my husband about what makes sense and what doesn\u2019t and we\u2019ll be clearer and more fair than before. \n\n2nd and last Edit to add:\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. I\u2019m still reading new replies but they mostly touch on things that have been discussed previously so I\u2019m not adding repeated replies. \n\nI spoke with my husband and he read the post. We agreed I have some OCD / germaphobia but it\u2019s not really negatively impacting our life, certainly not enough to need therapy. I should be nicer about him accidentally doing something I disagree with. \n\nAlso, I have nothing against therapy, I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to discuss / explore here. It\u2019s also not a panacea; the groupthink here to just suggest therapy to everyone who you disagree with is a bit concerning, but that\u2019s probably just Reddit being Reddit. I know most of you mean well. \n\nThank you again!

These flip flops have been out on the streets. The amount of germs and trash  they brought made me 100% sure I won\u2019t be taking a bath there. \n\nBut he got upset at me instead - according to him, I\u2019m making up new rules. He has always complained about me being overly obsessed with cleanliness. He thinks it\u2019s hard because  I change rules... I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just different circumstances call for different practices, I can\u2019t speak to all future circumstances, he should use his head... I don\u2019t think I changed the rules here because I feel like this is implied. It blows my mind that he thinks differently - am I AH for thinking this? \n\nOver the last 8 years of being together, we\u2019ve compromised, but I\u2019m realizing we are still very incompatible in terms of cleanliness.  \n\nI think he should apologize for ruining a relaxing bath. He won\u2019t because he feels that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and blames me for changing rules. \n\nSo AITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It became a habit I\u2019ve carried on even into my 4th decade. \n\nHowever, I still think OP is the AH here. Like you suggest, the bath can be cleaned. But I get neurosis doesn\u2019t necessarily work with logic so I can forgive OP for not being able to accept it being cleaned as good enough. Still the AH though because her husband has accommodated her and was simply following her rules. As logical as it seems to OP that the rules don\u2019t apply to this situation, she needs to understand that to others her rules are illogical to begin with so it therefore _isn\u2019t_ illogical for them to think the rules still apply on this scenario. Hope that makes sense. \n\nAlso having said that neurosis don\u2019t tend to be logical or even similar within people, I have to say I find it weird that OP would even want to take a bath in a hotel bath. That\u2019s a hell nope for me, I don\u2019t care how clean it\u2019s been cleaned.

We all need exposure to germs to maintain a healthy immune system, and being hyper sensitive about germs will not help you, your husband, or your child. Should things be at a decent level of cleanliness?  Absolutely.  But it will be impossible to keep a child from picking things up off the ground and putting it in their mouth, grabbing the same toy that another child just had in their hand after picking their nose or, god forbid, sitting on a hotel couch. You can\u2019t just \u201cset clearer rules\u201d. You need to get to the root cause of why you are thinking this way and finding ways to reasonably manage it.", "Yta. And I knew that as soon as I read \"trained my husband\" straight up nonsense talking about the man you love like he's a fucking pet", "YTA. Get therapy. Giant story time but here we go. \n\nMy partner is an OCD germaphobe who has gotten treatment but still struggles daily and we keep our house extremely clean and have many ritualistic things we do in regards to chores, outside vs. inside, groceries, etc in order to maintain his mental health. I love him and am happy to do what it takes to make him comfortable, but you are not being kind when you think it doesn\u2019t really affect his life that much. It does, and it takes a lot of effort to maintain an OCD germaphobe household, especially when you are constantly having to predict what is and isn\u2019t considered \u201cdirty.\u201d To you it seems he only has to make tiny changes to accommodate your level of cleanliness because the level of cleanliness you seek is logical TO YOU and therefore TO YOU it is just small daily changes, and some of them are, but what you are really asking him to do is not only accommodate your disordered thinking, but to understand and predict your disordered thinking. OCD is a disorder. Just like anxiety, narcissism, depression, etc. It is a hyper-sensitive mental function or reaction that is harmful to happy and productive function which is why we\u2019ve created therapy to help combat and manage these things within ourselves. Left to their own devices these disorders are destructive to daily function though the severity levels depend on the person.\n\nOne thing that I still struggle with my partner is the expectation that I should be able to understand and also change my thinking to match his if he can explain his thinking process in regards to what is and isn\u2019t \u201cdirty\u201d, even though he\u2019s gotten professional help and still continues therapy to manage his OCD. The mental load this puts on a partner is exhausting because it can feel like you are walking around on eggshells. I have been with my partner for 10 years and still discover new \u201crules\u201d all of the time that he assumed were logical, and they can make sense when you go step by step through the thought process, but the trail of logic that leads to it is not intuitive. (Ex: Just founded out a few months ago that while the table has always been \u201cdirty\u201d because we put our outside stuff on it that the chairs around the table are \u201cclean\u201d spaces because we need to sit on them when we eat and our inside clothes touch that. When explained it makes sense, but it also doesn\u2019t make sense because the entire table was designated as \u201cdirty\u201d and it\u2019s okay for us to eat food off of and have our inside clothes\u2019 sleeves and our hands and arms touch the top of the \u201cdirty\u201d table and that\u2019s not enough to make us \u201cdirty\u201d but the rest of us touching the chair does? I digress) I have told my partner and the continued expectation in our relationship is that that I am so happy to do what he needs to accommodate his needs so he is happy and comfy in our home, but he is not allowed to expect me to know it without him communicating and explaining what he needs and he is not allowed to get upset if I do something \u201cdirty\u201d that he has not explained as such because I can\u2019t be expected to anticipate and learn disordered logic. He is not allowed to hold my non-OCD brain to an OCD pattern of thinking. I\u2019m absolutely fine if he needs me to wipe the groceries off with a certain cleaner before putting them away, he us not allowed to get mad that I didn\u2019t naturally come to that conclusion or that I haven\u2019t made it habit if he has not told me he needs it. \n\nThe world is a dirty place. Sterile environments are an illusion. Even surgical sterilization cannot remove all germs. There is an inescapable amount of dirty that you must endure to just be alive, and it only gets dirtier if you\u2019re dead. However, most people have come to a general societal consensus on what is an acceptable level of dirtiness permissible in living and then most people exist within a reasonable spectrum. OCD germaphobe is not a reasonable spectrum and most of the time it is not actually patterns that beget actual sterile environments but give the illusion and mental comfort that you have achieved a sterile environment. You haven\u2019t actually achieved cleanliness, the rituals you do just make it feel clean. That tub was already rank, dank, and otherwise stank before he stood in it with his outside flip flops. Hotels and abnbs at most do basic wipe-downs, and sometimes not even that. It\u2019s a dirty place, and deep down you know that, you are just mad because the flip flops shattered the illusion, even though he was actively cleaning it. You threw a tantrum because he shattered your illusion of cleanliness and he should have \u201cknown better.\u201d\n\nYou need to get help so you stop placing the emotional burden of dealing with the dirtiness of the world on your partner rather than acknowledging and working on the fact that this is your mental problem. You can ask him to do clean things, you cannot keep asking your partner to manage your emotions in this regard.", "YTA and you do need therapy. It's obviously affecting your life in a negative way. \n\nDo you know how fucking **annoying** it is when your partner is so nitpicky about what's on your feet?
