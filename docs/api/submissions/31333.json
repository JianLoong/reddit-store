So I\u2019ve sort of \u201ctrained\u201d my husband to wear flip flops in hotels vs bare feet. We also wear flip flops into showers, or tubs that we don\u2019t plan to bathe in. But apparently he thinks this applies to a tub we are about to bathe in as well. \n\nTonight, we decided to bathe in the tub. He was about to use soap to wash the tub before the soak but I noticed he\u2019d worn his flip flops to shower in the tub. These flip flops have been out on the streets. The amount of germs and trash they brought made me 100% sure I wouldn\u2019t be taking a bath there. \n\nBut he got upset at me instead - according to him, I\u2019m making up new rules. I don\u2019t think I did because this is implied... It blows my mind that he thinks differently - am I AH for thinking this? \n\nI think he should apologize for ruining a relaxing bath. He won\u2019t because he feels that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and blames me for changing rules. \n\nSo AITAH?\n\nEdit to add: \nThank you all for your judgment. I\u2019m seeing a consensus that I\u2019m TA. Reasons: my \u201clogic\u201d for cleaning practices is unclear; my germaphobia would be improved if I actually learned how they work and how they impact the body; I should react more productively to my husband\u2019s \u201cmistakes\u201d when accommodating my special standards.  \n\nI also saw multiple messages to \u201cget therapy\u201d, I don\u2019t think I need it. 1) It\u2019s really not impacting my life or my husband\u2019s life that much, no need to extrapolate our life from this one incident, 2) I know I need to chill about germs and cleanliness. I\u2019m going to talk to my husband about what makes sense and what doesn\u2019t and we\u2019ll be clearer and more fair than before.

These flip flops have been out on the streets. The amount of germs and trash  they brought made me 100% sure I won\u2019t be taking a bath there. \n\nBut he got upset at me instead - according to him, I\u2019m making up new rules. He has always complained about me being overly obsessed with cleanliness. He thinks it\u2019s hard because  I change rules... I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just different circumstances call for different practices, I can\u2019t speak to all future circumstances, he should use his head... I don\u2019t think I changed the rules here because I feel like this is implied. It blows my mind that he thinks differently - am I AH for thinking this? \n\nOver the last 8 years of being together, we\u2019ve compromised, but I\u2019m realizing we are still very incompatible in terms of cleanliness.  \n\nI think he should apologize for ruining a relaxing bath. He won\u2019t because he feels that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and blames me for changing rules. \n\nSo AITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also cleanliness practices don\u2019t come naturally to him so he was already doing the flip flops thing for me. \n\nAlso true that I should just always bring Clorox wipes if I want to use the tub. It\u2019s my own germaphobia, I need to deal with it myself.", "Soap and scrubbing is good enough to clean anything. You wash a filthy poopy baby and everything else that got messy with soap, yes? You don't put bleach or cleaners on your skin, it's perfectly clean enough to feel 'normal and safe' with just soap. If soap's good enough for poo it's good enough for dirty shoes. All you had to do is scrub the tub- there's nothing tangibly left behind once you do. Once again, it's your ignorance and phobia holding you back. Someone else mentioned hand washing is good enough to kill Covid - there's a mental block preventing you from feeling that something is clean enough with just soap, and you need to address it.", "Your body is also colonized with bacteria, it\u2019s all on your skin washing it doesn\u2019t get rid of it for the most part and it would actually be detrimental to your health to get rid of it. I understand the neurosis as someone who has plantar warts from swimming, but bleach kills everything and so does alcohol. I always bring isopropyl alcohol to wipe everything down and wear flip flops in the tub but realistically our bodies can take it. There must be a gas station or store near you where you can just buy a sprayer of bleach to douse the tub in or your husband\u2019s shoes.\n\nIf you ever notice a pink hue to your tub or shower head that\u2019s actually bacteria that has colonized you.", "oh god, not MORE rules. that is the opposite of what we're all trying to say here.", "She wants it disinfected yet doesn't bring disinfectant.

You are, which wouldn't be bad in and of itself. It is bad when you are allowing it to spill over into your relationship. The rules you are coming up with are now contradictory.

If regular soap can wash away outside filth and general human filth from our bodies, it can wash away street filth from a tub floor.\n\nYou\u2019ve let your fear absolutely consume you. I can understand scrubbing a little soap around and washing it away before a bath, but unless y\u2019all are staying in some absolutely grimy hotels, showers shoes aren\u2019t necessary. If you aren\u2019t wanting to work on your issues and to save your husband headaches, just purchase a Tavel size spray bottle that has bathroom cleaner in it so y\u2019all can scrub the tub down right when you get in there.

Unless your going to lick the tub where is street filth flip flop was, simply scrubbing a bit with soap would be perfectly fine to do before running your bath.", "What I don't understand is why you're using the same flip-flops to wear outside and inside. Based on your fears, you should have outside flip-flops that immediately get put into bags or left by the door, and inside flip-flops that have never touched outside spaces, especially if you're going to wear them into the shower.", "Thank God for some common sense at last. Even if you were to lick the street in SF, you wouldn't die. It must be hideous to live your life wrapped up in so much unnecessary fear. And as for 'logic', there is none.

Why are you wearing outdoor shoes inside?

Do you still feel like you are owed an apology?", "You don't have 'cleanliness practices' but a cleaning neurosis that's not normal", "I like that you are willing to see this and compromise. An immediate reaction with a phobia is fair, and you seem able to logic your way out and apologize when necessary.  \n\nI'd just like to point out that public baths and shared bathwater have been around for centuries, and humanity has not just survived, but thrived. Showers are relatively new in comparison. But in any bath, you sit in your own bacteria (even if you rinse off first), both the good and bad kind. Fecal matter, urine residue, sweat, and dirt will float around, and... is so diluted from the average person that it is pretty harmless unless you drink a gallon of it. Regular soap is pretty effective. And if you want to feel actually clean, take a shower after - that's what I do!\n\nPersonally, I agree that it's annoying that he didn't see the issue. If you are doing shower sandals, they really should be an inside only thing. So while the dirt should DEFINITELY have been washed away with soap, it's unlikely that anything worse that your own body's excretions would have remained strong enough to survive that level of dilution. And you have hundreds of years of human survival to prove it!", "I should imagine that cleanliness practices do come naturally to your husband as what you're describing YOU do is definitely over the top and not normal. I really hope you get help and stop punishing your husband for being 'normal' and not obsessive over a perceived but not actual threat.", "I\u2019m going to read up about germs and be more reasonable with my fears.

HOW do you bathe in a shower?", "Yeah lol wait you\u2019re right - so if she wasn\u2019t planning on bathing in the tub she would have worn flip flops in it because the potentially lingering germs were too dangerous for her *feet*, but she has no issue bathing in those same potentially lingering germs if the *protective* flip flops haven\u2019t been in it?", "I can see why my logic may not be clear to him.

Kids know this!", "Look into contamination OCD. What you're describing sounds very similar. \n\nI have contamination OCD with food.
