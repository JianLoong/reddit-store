Many spouses wouldn\u2019t have still gone and broke their kids heart. Kudos to you !", "YWNBTA. I think the kids are old enough to decide whether or not they want to go. The fact that this particular son and your wife have issues isn't a reason that the other children should be excluded.

That's unfair.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour son wants his siblings at the wedding; all of the children involved (except for the 9-year-old) are old enough to decide themselves. The 9-year-old wouldn't understand why they couldn't go while the other siblings went. So they should all go (I don't think the reasoning actually needs to include your wife's emotions). They should not miss their siblings' wedding.\n\nYour wife and son don't have much of a relationship, and depending on how long you've been together, a lot of that responsibility would have fallen on your wife, and she clearly did not succeed in establishing a positive relationship with him. He's an adult now, and has chosen not to have her in his life, which is his right.\n\nDo not let your wife divide your children; that will hurt them. \n\nI hope your wife is able to reason this out. If either of them were open to it, family counseling might be an option, but it sounds like this might be beyond repair.

That is very odd.", "Those that you have some form of legal guardianship over there is no reason not to take....even if it does piss her off. Any that you don't, well that would probably not be legal. But yes, if your son wants the kids there, by all means take those that you (legally) can. You don't need her permission to do this if you can stand the blowback when you get home.", "If you legally adopted her children you can take all of the children.  If not the 19 year old is free to go on his own and your two biological children can absolutely go with you-- the 17 year old could probably hitch a ride with his brother.

There's a lot to this story that we don't have.", "YWNBTA, but it would obviously create a big rift with your wife. Of course, your oldest stepson technically could take the other half of the kids over your objections, depending on how much they weigh the cost/benefit of a fight with their mother.", "YWNBTA I understand that they don't get along but she seems to be making sure that he doesn't have a relationship with his siblings either. She should really appreciate that he's still willing to have a relationship with her kids in spite with a fact that they can't get along. He's really acting like the bigger person here and your other kids should not be punished because of her attitude.", "YWNBTA. If she wasn\u2019t invited it is clearly for a reason, specifically how she probably treated your son or simply they have no relationship. If the kids want to go and your son wants them to be there, they should be able to choose for themselves whether you go or not! It\u2019s pretty likely that your wife is hurt by not being invited, but this should be used as a time to reflect on why she wasn\u2019t invited instead of being a grown adult acting in petty manners. Bring the kids! Also, the fact that she doesn\u2019t want you to go to your own sons wedding simply because SHE wasn\u2019t invited it rather terrifying. She should be ecstatic that you have a good relationship with all of your children, not bitter!", "It sounds like your wife is just doing it to be spiteful and petty which makes her a huge AH. If the kids want to go and they can't because their mom can't get over herself, y'all risk the other kids hating her too and if it continues, don't expect them to keep in contact after 18 and the only one to blame is your wife and you. Take them to the wedding, they're innocent in all of this.", "Wow, this is hard. Choosing between your children and your marriage... Try to keep the peace and only take the ones you are allowed to.

If there isn\u2019t, is it possible for you to have your son extend an invitation to her? \n\nI do think all the kids should be able to go. Especially if they want to go.
