The cousin gets stuff first sometimes. You got your stepdaughter this skirt first this time. I don\u2019t think the skirt is really a factor of their relationship. Seems like they have jealousy that goes back and forth between them. \n\nSince you love your stepdaughter, you might try to guide her about being confident in her self and feeling comfortable to still buy and wear fashion she wants, even if her cousin has already bought something first.

There's no 'dibs' on taste, and no monopoly on what you like to wear.", "NTA. Guess what? Stores sell multiple items of clothing that more than 1 person buys.

A little, but hilariously so. And deserving given how her cousin acts.", "NTA\n\nYou just made your daughter's day, and boosted her self-esteem among her cousins. Don't know if guys get this, so don't be too hard on your husband, but it's absolutely a 'girl thing' and as vital as breathing to teenage girls. As she's always on the bottom of the heap thanks to her snotty cousin, I think she'd vote you 'mum of the year' for putting her one-up on top :)\n\nAs you grew out of your own teenage silliness, she will also grow out of this phase, but while she's in it, you've just made yourself the hero. Could you help her see how toxic her cousin is and discuss what alternatives she has?", "NTA. I\u2019m team OP here. Another option is have your stepdaughter tell her she likes some ugly expensive sweater dress or horrible shoes. It may be petty but hey, I\u2019m petty.", "NTA", "NTA.  But definitely talk to your stepdaughter about putting cuz on a low info diet. No more what she wants.. too much competition there. There will be no competition if she doesn't know. P.s. wtg step mom! Definitely keep up the great work. Maybe you can expand that by shopping trips and girls day out.", "Quite honestly, this is the stepparent relationship I am here for! NTA", "YTA. Wow these 2 teenagers show more maturity then you do as an adult. Keep us updated on how the marriage is doing in a few years", "Also a great and easy solution.  Not to be petty,  but I would just about die if the kid starts telling her cousin she wants only the ugliest and most expensive things.", ">you might try to guide her about being confident in her self and feeling comfortable to still buy and wear fashion she wants, even if her cousin has already bought something first\n\nYeah, I'm leaning very close to a Y T A here, because OP should be teaching her stepdaughter that she is allowed and encouraged to buy any clothes/accessories she wants, and that this 'only 1 person can have this thing \"rule\" ' is absolutely childish bullshit that should be ignored -- instead of reinforcing the idea that this BS \"rule\" is something to be respected, which is what OP is currently doing.", "Never heard of the \u2018rule\u2019 either. And it never would have worked in my family. My paternal grandmother always got my cousin and I the same gifts for Xmas", "Yes, it can be that or maybe it could be that I raised her since she was nine years old since her mom is not in the picture, so I consider her my daughter, and fortunately she considers me her mother too.", "Because she cares for her stepdaughter? Wouldn't that strengthen the marriage? \ud83e\udd14", "I was thinking about suggesting that but I didn\u2019t want to be too petty lol", "NTA, and you definitely shouldn\u2019t teach your stepdaughter to \u201clike\u201d expensive and ugly shit.  And she certainly should not be encourage to talk about how much she likes this crappy stuff in front of her cousin.  That would be very very petty.  \n\nWhen one of my kids had a project they were good at in school, already had the skills, and was ahead of the other kids, they argued with the teacher about how they wanted to do it, with the teacher insisting on a method the kid did NOT want to do.  Kid announced to me at home they would finish the first one (it was two identical things to make) early \u201cto show the teacher\u201d, I encouraged the kid to finish the second to the state the first was in last time the teacher saw it, while completing the first, and only show the teacher that second, unfinished one, that looked like no homework had been done, until teacher berated them, and *then* present the finished one..if you are going to be petty, do it in style.  We knew the teacher, well, so I was comfortable with the joke, I was a helper in the class.   Kid did the work, turned in the \u201cno home work done\u201d one, worked comedic timing perfectly, waited for the lecture, then presented the finished one with perfect nonchalance. I never saw someone\u2019s mouth literally from open in shock, before.  It was really funny.  Teacher thought so too, once done with the shock (my kid did a month of work in a week, there was no actual behavioral issue, only the classroom nonsense, and briefly tricking the teacher to think work had not been done).  So, that was me, teaching my kid to be petty.  Don\u2019t be like me.  Even if it is fun.", "Fair. OP, dont listen to me please! It was a joke and not something you need to explain to the cousins parents when it goes too far \ud83e\udd23"]}
