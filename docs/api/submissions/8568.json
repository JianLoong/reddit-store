We knew the teacher, well, so I was comfortable with the joke, I was a helper in the class.

Good on you for getting that skirt for her \"first\" because this will help her to have self-confidence in herself. Make it clear that wherever this \"rule\" came from, it is utter BS. These clothes are mass market. Many people will be wearing the clothes, although maybe not paired the same way. Your SD likely has seen multiple girls (even her friends) in her school wearing the same blouse/skirt/shoes/necklace/etc. as others and at the same time (gasp!). They may even show up completely by chance dressed exactly the same one day (extra gasps!). It sounds like this one cousin made up this \"rule\" so that she can be the most special and noticed of all the female cousins near her age, narcissism at its finest. I recommend that you pass onto your SD that she needs to go as LC with the one cousin as possible and an info diet (don't say what she likes, or wait to say what she likes until AFTER she's bought it). Also tell her to get the clothing she likes because her desires are more important than \"\\[Susie Mae\\] got that blouse so now I can't have it.\" That thought process is going to lead to an unnecessarily severely diminished wardrobe and a highly upset teen/YA. When she DOES talk with the one cousin and \"what do you like?\" gets asked, the response should be \"Nope. Not going to say, because then your going to go out and buy whatever it is I said I liked and throw a massive tantrum when I ignore your ridiculous \"rule\" and get it for myself, and I don't want to deal with your histrionics.\" Or only say what she likes much later when it's far too late for cousin to buy it first. Personally, I'd take the first response and watch cousin implode to being told no and being called out on her behavior.", "Was it a bit petty? Yes. Was it perfect? Also yes. NTA\n \nEdited to add: I get your husband's point about staying out, but when there's one person playing by nasty rules *sometimes* you've got to step in. It's better for everyone.

That means it is okay to wear the same style clothes other people are wearing. Your stepdaughter should stop telling her cousin about things she wants if she can\u2019t wear the same things if her cousin buys it first even if they never wear it. This is ridiculous and your stepdaughter doesn\u2019t need to play along with this dumb rule. She needs to know that she can wear what she wants and is not responsible for what other people choose.", "Tell stepdaughter to start picking ugly ass expensive things to talk to cousin about. Oh I'm petty ..", "NTA \n\nBut also I don\u2019t know what rule you are talking about. Last week in high school me and my friend got the same shirt and hoodie lol, and we were giving for the last week acting as twins.", "NTA.", "NTA", "INFO: are you seriously saying you married a 47 year old dude at age 20 and helped raise his then 9 year old daughter? \n\nIf so, you\u2019ve got a lot bigger problems then a skirt and an obnoxious cousin", "I\u2019m very curious what skirt is so recognizable!", "NTA. You are a great mother for supporting your daughter like that.", "What I would\u2019ve said would prob get me banned here, so instead, I\u2019m going to say that learning about when, why, and how bloating happens is a decent start.", "NTA for helping your girl win a round in this stupid game. But she needs to learn how to get off this competitive hamster wheel and figure out how to win for herself. Either she keeps quiet around the cousin, or starts misdirecting her by \"liking\" hideous things.", "NTA and I think it's great that you want to look out for her. My stepmother was an absolute nightmare from Hell, so it's nice to see bonus parents loving kids like their own.", "YTA\n\nYou're way too interested and seem to be encouraging that teenagers' drama. If your stepdaughter has an issue with her cousins behavior (and I notice you never said that she complained about it, only that YOU felt the behavior was unfair and a problem), she just has to stop sharing with her what she intends to buy.\n\nInstead of give her that advice, you just jumped in the clothes envy game. You look as immature as those teenage girls, or worse.", "No your not because kids always like the same things especially if it\u2019s popular and trending. If you could\u2019ve afforded to buy both of them the skirt they would\u2019ve been a kind gesture.", "That \u201crule\u201d itself is stupid and sounds like something made up for Mean Girls or some Hollywood stereotype of spoiled teenage rich girls. You should be discouraging the idea, not getting yourself personally involved in immature teenage drama. If your stepdaughter didn\u2019t care if other girls had the same stuff as her, it wouldn\u2019t bother her when t\u00e9 cousin bought it first. ESH\u2014the girls both for caring more about this idiotic rule than their relationship as cousins and you for encouraging it.", "Also, to talk to step daughter about the whole \"not getting something someone else has\" It's one thing if it's a special something (wedding dress type thing) but an everyday item of clothing, it doesn't matter. If you like it get it, don't allow someone else's taste in clothes (or whatever) to stop you. There's a reason that when we go into stores there are multiples of these items. \n\nYes, it can be hard habit/feeling to break. But in reality, it doesn't matter. I have a few things that friends and even acquaintances have gotten. Sometimes it's by coincidence, sometimes it's bc they saw me wearing it and like it. They are not \"stealing\" anything from me. \n\nAlso, if stepdaughter stops caring, it very well make cousin stop doing this (at least to her). If cousin can't get a reaction, if dtepdaughter is going to get and wear what she likes regardless and doesn't feed into any \"you're copying me!\" tantrum bs, cousin won't get the enjoyment out of doing it anymore.", "Maybe also tell her it's ridiculous you can't buy something you like because your friend already bought it? What if that starts including drinks or food?", "It really is a dumb rule. Even if they *didn't* tell anyone the stuff they will buy, chances are other people they know will buy them anyway. My best friend and I ended up buying the same coat without realising and we unknowingly wore the coats at the same time when we met up. We found it funny and complimented eachother's fashion taste.", "I can't tell you how happy it makes me that you did this for your SD. Well done! And the other advice is good too.", "Damn, good eye.  I definitely did not spot that on my first read-through.  OP buried the lede over here.", "She's only ten years older than the daughter. She was 19 and the daughter was 9 and dad was already an old man. This is just bizarre", "I\u2019m all for team petty", "Yes this! Really awful things, keep the things she really wants to herself. \n\n\nI had friends like this as a teen, so I don\u2019t think the whole I have it so you can\u2019t thing is new. I got to a point where I thought screw it. I want it I\u2019m buying it regardless. I actually had a couple of \u2018friends\u2019 write a list of things I wasn\u2019t even allowed to like because they did\u2026. Teenage girls are awful sometimes", "Oh yes! This was my thought.  Simply start picking out hideous clothes to see if see keeps doing it! NTA!", "Eh, that's one of those things teenagers grow out of, I remember being that age and we had dumbass \"rules\" that we followed heart and soul to death for like...a year and then moved on. \n\nTeenagers are stupid, end of day they make dumb decisions and social rules they follow. It happens with everyone. OP is NTA for sure.", "So\u2026 the age of the daughter she views as her own currently is. Wonder how she would feel if that daughter was dating a 46 year old.", "Ewww.  So gross. His wife is only 10 years older than his daughter.", "WTF??", "OP was 19 and dating a 46-year-old. There's no \"getting over\" anything. That's wrong.", "You definitely married a father figure in your husband and see yourself in your stepdaughter. You're probably righting the wrongs of your childhood. A lot of therapy is needed.", "I am confused you say that there is a rule that if one person buys something no else can get it. First of all it is a stupid rule, because stores usually have more than one of an item. But then when you get your stepdaughter the skirt she is happy because everybody wears it. So which is it ?", "I could see that conversation playing out really well.", "Yes, this is great!\n\nLink to the automod for people who don't want to scroll for it: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6jiad/comment/iy1ot8g/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "LMAO she being all \"why did you want to buy this bag in the first place\"? was the cherry on top, what a legend.", "14yo me would have been extremely offended with your comment", "OP's stepdaughter is currently being **bullied** because of these \"dumbass rules\".\n\nThe biggest favor OP can do for her stepdaughter is to give her the confidence and self-assurance to know that it's okay to ignore these \"dumbass rules\", and to scoff openly at the cousin who is bullying her.", "She talks and sees her daughters when she wants, that's why I said this in my other post:\n\n> And the truth is that the girls live with us and never see their mother (because she is always busy traveling for work or on vacation with her friends) I am the one who plays the role of mother", ">You definitely married a father figure in your husband\n\nIt was like that and I admit it, I grew up without a father and the only two people I was in a relationship with were old enough to be my dad and I know that's not normal, which is why I'm in therapy now but that doesn't change the fact that i love my husband, just to clarify.", "For them it works this way: people they don't know can wear the same thing as them, I mean strangers they see on the street, but friends and relatives can't because they usually coincide at parties or family gatherings where they take photos and they don't want someone else to be wearing the same thing as them in the photos. For me that doesn't make sense but for them it does, I don't know if I explained it well.", "It's really bad advice but funny as hell.", "To be honest 14 year old me would have considered it.", "Not as bad as that wardrobe will be\u2026"]}
