Don't know if guys get this, so don't be too hard on your husband, but it's absolutely a 'girl thing' and as vital as breathing to teenage girls. As she's always on the bottom of the heap thanks to her snotty cousin, I think she'd vote you 'mum of the year' for putting her one-up on top :)\n\nAs you grew out of your own teenage silliness, she will also grow out of this phase, but while she's in it, you've just made yourself the hero. Could you help her see how toxic her cousin is and discuss what alternatives she has?", "NTA. I\u2019m team OP here.

And she certainly should not be encourage to talk about how much she likes this crappy stuff in front of her cousin.  That would be very very petty.  \n\nWhen one of my kids had a project they were good at in school, already had the skills, and was ahead of the other kids, they argued with the teacher about how they wanted to do it, with the teacher insisting on a method the kid did NOT want to do.  Kid announced to me at home they would finish the first one (it was two identical things to make) early \u201cto show the teacher\u201d, I encouraged the kid to finish the second to the state the first was in last time the teacher saw it, while completing the first, and only show the teacher that second, unfinished one, that looked like no homework had been done, until teacher berated them, and *then* present the finished one..if you are going to be petty, do it in style.  We knew the teacher, well, so I was comfortable with the joke, I was a helper in the class.   Kid did the work, turned in the \u201cno home work done\u201d one, worked comedic timing perfectly, waited for the lecture, then presented the finished one with perfect nonchalance. I never saw someone\u2019s mouth literally from open in shock, before.  It was really funny.  Teacher thought so too, once done with the shock (my kid did a month of work in a week, there was no actual behavioral issue, only the classroom nonsense, and briefly tricking the teacher to think work had not been done).  So, that was me, teaching my kid to be petty.  Don\u2019t be like me.  Even if it is fun.", "Fair. OP, dont listen to me please!

I get not liking the way she treats your step-daughter, but the right thing to do (imo) is to tell step-daughter to stop talking to her all the time.  And more importantly, tell her it's okay for her to buy whatever she wants even if someone else has it.  They're not one of a kind clothes.  I'm sure millions of people have the same pieces.

Don\u2019t go crazy, but a few things here and there wouldn\u2019t hurt lol. \n\nI\u2019d love am update if you do anything!", "NTA. I'm going to reiterate some things from other comments. Good on you for getting that skirt for her \"first\" because this will help her to have self-confidence in herself. Make it clear that wherever this \"rule\" came from, it is utter BS. These clothes are mass market. Many people will be wearing the clothes, although maybe not paired the same way. Your SD likely has seen multiple girls (even her friends) in her school wearing the same blouse/skirt/shoes/necklace/etc. as others and at the same time (gasp!). They may even show up completely by chance dressed exactly the same one day (extra gasps!). It sounds like this one cousin made up this \"rule\" so that she can be the most special and noticed of all the female cousins near her age, narcissism at its finest. I recommend that you pass onto your SD that she needs to go as LC with the one cousin as possible and an info diet (don't say what she likes, or wait to say what she likes until AFTER she's bought it). Also tell her to get the clothing she likes because her desires are more important than \"\\[Susie Mae\\] got that blouse so now I can't have it.\" That thought process is going to lead to an unnecessarily severely diminished wardrobe and a highly upset teen/YA. When she DOES talk with the one cousin and \"what do you like?\" gets asked, the response should be \"Nope. Not going to say, because then your going to go out and buy whatever it is I said I liked and throw a massive tantrum when I ignore your ridiculous \"rule\" and get it for myself, and I don't want to deal with your histrionics.\" Or only say what she likes much later when it's far too late for cousin to buy it first. Personally, I'd take the first response and watch cousin implode to being told no and being called out on her behavior.", "Was it a bit petty? Yes. Was it perfect? Also yes. NTA\n \nEdited to add: I get your husband's point about staying out, but when there's one person playing by nasty rules *sometimes* you've got to step in. It's better for everyone. And your husband has (probably) never been a teenaged girl :)", "JFC I\u2019m sure you DO know how these teens feel!  You\u2019re way closer to their age then your husband (almost twice your age!).
