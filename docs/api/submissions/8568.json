We knew the teacher, well, so I was comfortable with the joke, I was a helper in the class.

Good on you for getting that skirt for her \"first\" because this will help her to have self-confidence in herself. Make it clear that wherever this \"rule\" came from, it is utter BS. These clothes are mass market. Many people will be wearing the clothes, although maybe not paired the same way. Your SD likely has seen multiple girls (even her friends) in her school wearing the same blouse/skirt/shoes/necklace/etc. as others and at the same time (gasp!). They may even show up completely by chance dressed exactly the same one day (extra gasps!). It sounds like this one cousin made up this \"rule\" so that she can be the most special and noticed of all the female cousins near her age, narcissism at its finest. I recommend that you pass onto your SD that she needs to go as LC with the one cousin as possible and an info diet (don't say what she likes, or wait to say what she likes until AFTER she's bought it). Also tell her to get the clothing she likes because her desires are more important than \"\\[Susie Mae\\] got that blouse so now I can't have it.\" That thought process is going to lead to an unnecessarily severely diminished wardrobe and a highly upset teen/YA. When she DOES talk with the one cousin and \"what do you like?\" gets asked, the response should be \"Nope. Not going to say, because then your going to go out and buy whatever it is I said I liked and throw a massive tantrum when I ignore your ridiculous \"rule\" and get it for myself, and I don't want to deal with your histrionics.\" Or only say what she likes much later when it's far too late for cousin to buy it first. Personally, I'd take the first response and watch cousin implode to being told no and being called out on her behavior.", "Was it a bit petty? Yes. Was it perfect? Also yes. NTA\n \nEdited to add: I get your husband's point about staying out, but when there's one person playing by nasty rules *sometimes* you've got to step in. It's better for everyone.

At least she won't be privy to what the other girls want to buy and wear until she actually sees them wear it.  Your husband is right, but I would have done the same thing!  If your stepdaughter begins to keep quiet about fashion around the cousin, there will not be a need for you to intervene again.  The cousin's behavior screams insecurity and if your stepdaughter is close to her, she can build her up by complimenting what she wears, her hair style and other things.  She can even get all the other cousins to begin doing the same without telling them so.  Once she gives a compliment in front of the group a few times, they will begin mimicking and doing the same.

Perhaps you could teach/encourage your step-daughter to put her own twist on her clothes or fashion - hair, jewelry, shoes (unless the cousin starts copying there too.) One thing I don't see mentioned is educating your husband about teenage girl life. Guys have no experience with this ever in their lives so I'm not surprised he doesn't see this (and probably other \"girl stuff\") as a big deal. Ask him about his school years.

Gifted children often start hating school as they get older because they are so bored. Teachers who don't understand their special needs can make things worse by doing exactly what this teacher did. It was my experience that gifted boys started acting out, and then get into trouble, but the girls just go silent and get depressed. I know some people are against labeling, but they are doing their child a disservice if it means they do not get the academic stimulation and level of challenge they need to stay engaged and grow. The other students always know who the smart kids are, and often isolate and bully them as they get older. Gifted kids are just as far from the mean as more intellectually challenged ones, and have special needs and understanding too.

I had a different kid in public school getting push in help for one subject, pull out help for another, and then pull out extra enrichment math, instead of the weekly review time.  These kids are all now adults, and we have dealt with lots of Neuropsych testing, special ed, on the spectrum, dyslexia, public school services, and several types of private schools.  All of these schools were on top of keeping kids engaged.   \n\nMy kid was being stubborn about not wanting to use the techniques the class was using, and the teacher wasn\u2019t wrong, there were advantages to what the class was doing, we just did it differently at home for different advantages.  Trying out both is sensible. I\u2019m always telling people to try all the ways, so you can choose with full knowledge. Teacher said they could do their next project however they wanted, as it was extra. My kid was just in a stage where they didn\u2019t want to listen!
