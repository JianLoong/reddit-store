If she wants the chicken she can pay for her own meal or at the very least pay the difference in price. \n\nBut I think the best option for everyone is to uninvite her.  Is your sibling really going to enjoy themselves at a meal where your grandmother will almost certainly be commenting on everyone's eating? \n\nI sympathize with the fact that she's clearly got disordered eating, but that doesn't give her a free pass to be mean.  Also blasting you on social media is completely uncalled for.  Your grandma's been playing some gaping asshole games, so it's fine for her to win the asshole prize of being uninvited.

Fat tissue redistribution in CS leads to central obesity and metabolic complications. Visceral obesity is associated to altered adipokine secretion further contributing to insulin resistance, inflammation and fat accumulation.\n\nA significant proportion (9.33%) of patients with simple obesity were found to have Cushing\u2019s syndrome. These findings argue that obese patients should be routinely screened for Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\n\nPeople who have obesity can have Cushing's. Cushing's can cause obesity as a result of a medical condition.\n\nI went on the Mayo clinic page for Cushing's Syndrome. These are potential causes for it.\n\nThe condition can be due to your body producing either too much cortisol or too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which regulates cortisol production.\n\nIn these cases, Cushing syndrome may be related to:\n\nA pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma). A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces an excess amount of ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol. When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease. It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n\nAn ACTH-secreting tumor. Rarely, a tumor that develops in an organ that normally doesn't produce ACTH will begin to secrete this hormone in excess. These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.\nA primary adrenal gland disease. Disorders of the adrenal glands can cause them to produce too much cortisol. The most common is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma, but only a small fraction of adenomas produce too much cortisol.\n\nCancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well. Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome.\n\nFamilial Cushing syndrome. Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.\n\nYour Grandma is blaming Cushing's for obesity when it can cause obesity. She's using a part of a medical condition that can cause cancer as an insult. If left untreated, Cushing's can lead to death.", "NTA - but. she's also your grandma. you won't have her around for many more years and you dont know what shes been through in life. even though she's being ridiculous and obsessed with weight why not just be kind and splurge e tra $5 or wtvr to make an old lady happy?\n\nit's not about right or wrong. it's about being kind and understanding because it's a nice thing for someone who raised your parent.", "You should stop inviting her too."]}
