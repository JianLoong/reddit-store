When they arrived, I informed them politely that I would prefer they not enter with their shoes on, especially considering that the day before there was a massive cleaning spree all over the place and I'd like to maintain that environment as it was. He mentioned that it wasn't a big deal, and that he's generally a very hygienic person personally and can guarantee that his shoes aren't going to cause any issue. I informed him that I don't see how his personal hygiene practices have any particular relation to the cleanliness of his shoes, and declared that I have no particular interest in his personal life and what he does, but that he should accept my desire given being in my house considering I would have done the same were I at his. He then said I should just get over it and not turn it into a problem, expressing the thought that it's not like I'm going to tell them to just sod off just for this \"stupid shit\". So, that's just exactly what I did since they asked for it.\n\nNow, nearly everyone in our friend group thinks I massively overreacted, in that it's okay to have some kind of boundary or rule but not to the point of turning away somebody coming to visit because it makes me look like a huge dick. I told them that there are a multitude of pragmatic reasons that perfectly justify not being in people's houses with shoes on, but I don't have the time to debate that with every single individual who shows up to my place. Also, I was not specifically trying to make it a concern or difficulty, removing your shoes barely takes ten seconds or less, mindlessly arguing about it however is the kind of thing that does waste the time of human beings. And it was at this moment I was blocked from the group chat. To me, this just showed their true colors anyway so I don't really care, but I'd like Reddit's opinion on this.

Others may say your reaction was extreme but the friend is the one who made it a problem in the first place over something so common.", "NTA. Having a \"shoes off\" rule is quite common and one that guests should respect.", "NTA.  Your friend should have simply respected your house rule regarding shoes.  There is no such a thing as clean shoes unless it\u2019s a brand new pair that has never been worn outside.  It sounds like you asked very nicely but was met with an entitled attitude.  Why do people think it\u2019s ok to disrespect other people\u2019s house rules?

Your friend challenged you and you simply met the challenge.", "NTA What those who aren't \"shoes off before entering the house\" people might not understand is that beyond a rational evaluation of how much filth one person wearing their shoes inside your house can bring in, there is the psychological aspect. It's a boundary where the inside is clean and the outside isn't. The shoes coming inside breaks that feeling of cleanliness when everybody in the household and all other visitors have been maintaining and respecting it for years on a daily basis.\n\nIt's a bit similar to a smoker expecting to be able to smoke a single cigarette inside a non-smoker's house. To the smoker that is nothing, but to the non-smoker it would feel like a violation of their personal space as would any lingering smell.

Also, I wish people who won't let guests in their houses with shoes on (which by itself is very reasonable) would let the guests know in advance so that they can choose the shoes and especially socks that they'll wear (e.g. sometimes I might wear a sock with a hole in it if I think it is the only one that goes well with my outfit - I would never do that if I expected to take my shoes off in front of others).", "NTA.\nPersonal hygiene has nothing to do with the sole of your shoe.

When they arrived, I informed them politely that I would prefer they not enter with their shoes on, especially considering that the day before there was a massive cleaning spree all over the place and I'd like to maintain that environment as it was. He mentioned that it wasn't a big deal, and that he's generally a very hygienic person personally and can guarantee that his shoes aren't going to cause any issue. I informed him that I don't see how his personal hygiene practices have any particular relation to the cleanliness of his shoes, and declared that I have no particular interest in his personal life and what he does, but that he should accept my desire given being in my house considering I would have done the same were I at his. He then said I should just get over it and not turn it into a problem, expressing the thought that it's not like I'm going to tell them to just sod off just for this \"stupid shit\". So, that's just exactly what I did since they asked for it.\n\nNow, nearly everyone in our friend group thinks I massively overreacted, in that it's okay to have some kind of boundary or rule but not to the point of turning away somebody coming to visit because it makes me look like a huge dick. I told them that there are a multitude of pragmatic reasons that perfectly justify not being in people's houses with shoes on, but I don't have the time to debate that with every single individual who shows up to my place. Also, I was not specifically trying to make it a concern or difficulty, removing your shoes barely takes ten seconds or less, mindlessly arguing about it however is the kind of thing that does waste the time of human beings. And it was at this moment I was blocked from the group chat. To me, this just showed their true colors anyway so I don't really care, but I'd like Reddit's opinion on this.

Please read this long story to the end and I promised you that somebody's life will be, if not saved, greatly improved.  For eight years I had between 5 and 50 psoriatic fissures on each foot.  Stress was the major factor influencing the severity of the presentation.  About 20% of the time I had these fissures they spotted blood. There was never a flow of blood per se. These fissures started inside my feet and spread to the surface.  If I did not move my feet for about four hours the fissures would plaque over.  Plaques grow at a rate of about 10 times the normal rate of skin growth.  Plaquing is very itchy and I would spend a minimum of an hour a day buffing the plaques off my feet to stop the itching.  Although the fissuring was painful, I preferred it to the itching of the plaques.\n\n\r  \nI did wear socks.  And it was almost impossible to wear any shoes because shoes were so painful. Additionally the Fissures had  caused an infection in my foot.  Within two days my whole leg was swollen from my toes to my hip, almost twice its normal size.  I developed Lymphedema.  And then none of my shoes would fit me because of the swelling.  It's only recently, seven or eight years after that infection, that I was able to fit into some of the shoes I used to be able to wear.  Even during the coldest parts of the year I would wear flip flops.\r  \nMost people don't realize that psoriasis is an extremely deadly disease.  The average loss of life expectancy for a woman diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriasis after the age of 25 is 20 years.  A diagnosis of moderate to severe psoriasis made before a woman turns 25 leads to a 30-year loss of life expectancy.  This is because of the comorbidities.  As you can imagine, with these extremely painful wounds on my feet, I found it very difficult to walk.  Some days, walking half a block was a struggle.  I developed diabetes and a host of other comorbid diseases.\n\n\r  \nAbsolutely the worst part of my disease was navigating our punitive senseless cruel health care system.  I did a lot of research and I discovered that over 50% of every health care dollar is spent on the administrative denial of healthcare.  I can certainly attest that I spent a lot more time fighting healthcare denial than I spent getting health care.  The medication that was effective in bringing me to remission was Otezla.  It costs almost $4,000 a month.\r  \n\r  \nOtezla's patent was brought by a company whose only motivation in marketing Otezla was maximization of profits. The whole nonsense about we have to pay inventors for the rewards for their work is a fallacy.  Most sophisticated drugs are developed at the margins of research which is almost completely subsidized by the federal government.  Most research is done in institutions that are given incredible tax advantages.  Even though most of the money spent in developing modern drugs is taxpayer money, taxpayers are never given any return on their financial investment.  Drug patents are a money making scam wherein the drug companies pour money into the politicians\u2019 coffers and the politicians give these companies outrageous advantages.  American patients, who's tax dollars funded the drug development, cannot afford these drugs and die.\n\n\r  \nAfter four years of being on Otezla, I decided that the horrors that the health care system visited upon me were much greater than the horrors of my painful, disabling, and deadly disease.  Fortunately, my disease only comes back when I'm extremely stressed out. \n\n\r  \nAfter I got off of the medication. I found that I had about a 90-plus percentage reduction in my disease\u2019s incidences and severity.  It's such an amazing experience to be facing what you are sure is the certainty of your accelerated and painful decline, leading to your probable death in the next year or two, and then substantially regain your health.\n\n\r  \nI am so appreciative of every gift life gives me.  I am so happy just to wake up in the morning, go out into the sunshine and breathe air as I walk through my garden. I ask little more of life than to be useful to others and enjoy these things.\n\n\r  \nYou may wonder, what got me through those years? \n\n\r  \nI learned how to manage my pain by smiling.  I do not take painkillers.  When I was trying to learn how to handle my pain, I read that smiling releases serotonin, and serotonin helps control pain.  So, I controlled my pain by putting and keeping on the biggest, most maniacal smile, 24/7.  I could not look at people while I was walking down the street because it obviously upset them if this bizarrely smiling woman looked at them.  I worked a series of temporary jobs, and I would often hear coworkers mocking and deriding me for my \"fake\" smile.\n\n\r  \nI was fired from a job for smiling -- a client was angry at me because I kept on smiling when she was upset with me for bruising her ego.  The day after being fired my leg swelled to twice its normal size due to an infection.   I was told that if I ever had another infection as severe as the one that I had at that time, I would probably lose my entire leg to amputation.\n\n\r  \nBut the serotonin released by the physical act of smiling not only brought my pain down to manageable levels, I stayed in a fantastic mood without a hint of the depression that I battled for much of my life.  To this day I try to keep a smile on my face because it puts me in such a good mood.  When I tell other people who suffer from serious, chronic pain about how smiling relieved my pain, at least half of them become very angry at me and accuse me of diminishing or dismissing the reality of their pain.  Sometimes chronic pain, just like chronic depression, can be a crutch one clings to.\n\n\r  \nI don't know if keeping a determined smile on one's face is truly the key to happiness, but it certainly works for me.  I like to tell this story because I hope that there is someone who will hear it and find the same relief and joy that I did.", "Can't have a space for absolutely everyone to sit down constantly.
