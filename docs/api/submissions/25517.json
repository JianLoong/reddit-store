Moopsy and my dads wills at the time were the same- first, everything goes to the surviving spouse, and then once the surviving spouse died everything was to be split evenly between us and Moopsy\u2019s kids.

After a few years, I moved out of state but she would occasionally relent and attend a thanksgiving, or allow us to take her to lunch when I was in town. This went on for another 10 years, but last fall she told me during one of our breakfast meetings that she had incurable cancer that had spread.  A few weeks later, she landed in the hospital and asked me to come as quickly as I could.

I spent the next few days with her until her other family members could arrive. They then took over the situation, and pretty much dismissed me. They took her back to their home state where she died six weeks later.\n\nAfter a few months, I contacted her granddaughter to find out the status of the estate. If nothing else, there were items around my fathers military service we wanted to collect. She shared the estate document with me, which showed that Moopsy had written me and my siblings out of everything- not recently, but way back when my father died.\n\nIt is now nearly a year after she died, and her final wishes were to be interred with my father.
