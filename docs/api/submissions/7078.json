Cry for the child that you were, then determine to make your life better.  You might also find solace in helping some other kid somehow.", "You might be the asshole to yourself if you told them. If they can't accept you saying that you have PTSD and flashbacks (which seem like things most people, even marginal assholes, would just accept at face value and respect!), do you think that dredging up those memories and sharing them is really going to get them off your back? These people seem pretty awful if they're doing this even after you told them you had unspecified issues (pro tip: when people don't talk about their issues, it's usually because *they're pretty bad)*, and I wouldn't necessarily trust them to do better when they have the details about what went down.\n\nSo NTA officially, but tread carefully here so you don't wind up in the same situation but with more details for these people to aim at you.", "If the case wasn't sealed, you might be able to get the documents again from https://scholar.google.com/ .  Pick caselaw, the state and court then google the names in the case.  Much of that kind of information has been scanned in and sits around now.  That said, I don't know why you want these assholes to approve of you.  They're not really worth your time if they're invalidating those kinds of feelings.  These are serious diseases of the mind and, regardless of the original trigger, it's there now.  They don't get to play armchair psychiatrist and eat their cake too.", "You'd be better off removing them from your social media because they may not believe you.", "Is it worth having people in your life who make snide comments on posts where you\u2019re trying to express your feelings about your trauma? If someone\u2019s initial reaction to reading about *someone else\u2019s trauma* is to make a cruel snide replies that\u2019s not the kind of person you want in your life OP, and they certainly don\u2019t deserve your emotional labor, why care what they think? Block them.\n\nIf you want to explain your side of things because you know it will make you feel better then go for it, but don\u2019t do it to prove other people wrong or to seek some kind of validation from them. Allot of people will hear someone\u2019s truth and just dig their heels in deeper and that can be incredibly upsetting an kind of borderline re-traumatizing for the truth teller, and you\u2019ve been through enough already OP.", "Honestly just block them and move on with your life. They *know*. They know that this person is a serial child abuser. They just have an image in their heads of that person and you challenging it will cause a problem. NTA but you\u2019ll just hurt yourself.", "NTA - but you should be able to get paperwork from court hearings.", "It's just not that easy.  Being estranged from family is a big, hurtful, lifelong ache that never goes away.  Particularly when you are \"innocent\" but there is no way to prove that.", "I\u2019m not saying that if you don\u2019t have proof it didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m sorry if it came across that way, but them likely not believing you regardless is just something to think about", "This is an excellent comment!!! OP, you don\u2019t have to keep silent about any abuse but do not expect people to change when you tell them.", "I've tried twice to get my court records.  They have \"vanished\".  It's not true.  A FIOP (Canada) request will be next.  Childrens Aid/Ontario government doesn't want records made public because the drugs, alcohol and abuse were pretty bad inside \"care\". I hadn't smoked so much as smoked a joint when I was given to the courts.   \"Care\" changed all that.  Many indigenous kids that weren't in residential schools were scooped up by Children's Aid.  So records go missing.\n\nI'm doing this for me.  To remind myself that I'm sane in the face of complete denial on the part of my remaining family."]}
