When dad heard this he decided we would not go to see her. I argued against his decision. He said our half siblings wanted to be there and would always remember being denied the chance to say goodbye. I argued that the oldest two would remember at 8 and 7. But the others were four and younger and would not. I also said her final few days or weeks were about my sister and nobody else. He still refused and I told him I would never forgive him if he kept me from my sister, my real sister, the one I came into this world with and was supposed to have for my whole life at my side.

I sat on the DM for a few days and then I replied firmly that I did not care about their feelings and they would not be around my daughter. I said I have every right to honor my sister and to please stay away from my Facebook page, which we're not friends on anyway, if she is bothered.\n\nI had to go private after this because I was inundated with messages from her and my half brother who said I was an ass and cruel.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694780181, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jbqi2/aita_for_being_firm_with_my_teenage_half_sibling/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is a painful memory for them? And your baby simply being named after a flower she loved is a trigger for them? they can fuck right off. She was your damn twin. And the way your father can throw away and replace family like that is also sick. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your losses.

Your early years have come with a lot of hurt. The loss of your mother and the loss of your sister are major. That your father could not respect your sister\u2019s wishes is very disappointing but not surprising. His focus shifted to his new family.  I am glad you were able to be there for your sister. \n\nWith regard to naming your new born (congratulations by the way) I think it so appropriate to honor your twin sister this way, and I\u2019d say it is no one else\u2019s business what you name your child. \n\nOn to the particulars of your interactions with your half sister. Sadly she has been feed on resentment and bitterness by your father and her mother over the years since you left. Which on its own is very sad. Understanding that she does not have her own opinion or the maturity to evaluate anything regarding you or your sister objectively or with any other information available than the poison she has been fed - her position would be expected, but that doesn\u2019t excuse her from being an AH for expressing it or for attempting to tell you anything about naming your child. \n\nI don\u2019t know if her intention was to reconnect but if it was - it was done badly. You can\u2019t reconnect with anyone by attacking or insulting them - especially over something that has nothing to do with them. \n\nWishing you the best and all the best to your little one.", "NTA- honestly, your Facebook should be private anyway because any sort of bot can lift those photos of your baby and use them for advertisements.   \n\nI've read stories about moms finding family pages featuring their own children.", "The first DM sounded like they did see it as a chance to connect but believe that for that reason I should have not named my daughter in honor of my sister. I can imagine my dad and his wife were very dramatic about the fact my sister refused to let them or their mom see her and the fact he stood with them and ignored my sister before she died while I went every day. I remember they questioned why I still got to see her back then but I didn't pay much attention to their questions at the time.", "He should have but I don't think it surprised her much at the time that he didn't.
