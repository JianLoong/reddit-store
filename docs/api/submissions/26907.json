Sadly she has been feed on resentment and bitterness by your father and her mother over the years since you left. Which on its own is very sad. Understanding that she does not have her own opinion or the maturity to evaluate anything regarding you or your sister objectively or with any other information available than the poison she has been fed - her position would be expected, but that doesn\u2019t excuse her from being an AH for expressing it or for attempting to tell you anything about naming your child. \n\nI don\u2019t know if her intention was to reconnect but if it was - it was done badly.

Wanting and insisting that his new wife and her kids visit your dying sister could have been about him showing your sister that her death wasn\u2019t going to leave him abandoned.  How else to explain the anger and hostility coming from him and his sending you away. You going elsewhere was him abandoning you before you too could desert him.

His behaviors taught you he had no empathy; no love.\n\nBut all that time you weren\u2019t in his life, he remained angry.  Pushing you away didn\u2019t solve his problem.  So he kept working it with his second wife and her family. Seems from what they said to you there was an expectation that one day you would want all of them to be your family.  Where did that come from after all that no contact time.  Why were they expecting you to need them after you had a baby.  \nGuessing your dad has changed me to realize he screwed up.

Yes ur sister had the right to choose who she allowed or not, I feel for the half sibs as it wasn\u2019t their choice to be born and it sounds like ur sister (and maybe u too?) had (still have?) issues with them just because they were born and ur dad moved on from ur mom (I could be wrong!). BUT their reaction to u naming ur daughter and blaming it as pain on them is absolutely BS. Sadly it\u2019s probably because of ur dad and step mom that they believe that as that\u2019s what they would have been taught i believe so please do try and consider that fact when dealing with the sibs. Do set ur boundaries and be firm on them though! They need to respect them and u can name ur child whatever u want and they do not get a say", "Most definitely NTA. Now you did say some hateful things to your father but that reaction from him is horrible. The great thing is that you choose to have whoever you want in your life and if they aren\u2019t on the list then that\u2019s their problem and not yours.", "It sounds like you were more than firm, you were a bit angry (but not much) in your response.

That's horrible", "If the question is ever \u2018who is the asshole, a teenager literally on their deathbed or someone else\u2019, it\u2019s going to be the other person. I don\u2019t care if the dying teenager is screaming nazi shit at a black doctor, just give them space to die their own way and make your peace with it after. \n\nYour dad desperately needs years of therapy but that\u2019s his problem. And his kids have spent years being poisoned against you, and you\u2019ll probably never have a relationship with them. You owe them nothing, but if there is any part of you that would like something to do with that part of the family, just keep your mind open to speaking to them when they\u2019re adults and maybe have had time to see their father for who he really is.", "Totally true, but don't miss the commenter's point that your half-siblings are also victims of this situation. That doesn't mean it's acceptable for them to act that way or mean you can't respond properly, but try to remember that the only view they probably have of you and your sister is the one your father created for them. Manipulation is **powerful**, especially when it comes from someone you trust and believe-in. They probably have never had a reason to believe he's full of it.", "Bad bot.

She could have let them in to say goodbye ONE time.\n\nYes, the dad is a much, much larger asshole, and the 16 y/o who contacted OP is bigger than the OP's twin was, but OP's twin still did Asshole behavior.", "It\u2019s worse than that.

Oh, and my sister ALSO works with both my mother and DBs mother on the same floor at the local hospital, so its something thats always just in the background for them.\n\nA lifetime of propaganda works on people all the time, and its almost assured when the propaganda is coming from someone you love and trust.. just because those kids are teens doesnt mean they've had a reason to reevaluate what they know, or would even accept that they're in the wrong.

To pick up and move you and your sister away, presumably from your grandparents and a source of support for you, seems so suspicious. Especially to then start dating immediately after the move.
