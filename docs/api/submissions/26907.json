Sadly she has been feed on resentment and bitterness by your father and her mother over the years since you left. Which on its own is very sad. Understanding that she does not have her own opinion or the maturity to evaluate anything regarding you or your sister objectively or with any other information available than the poison she has been fed - her position would be expected, but that doesn\u2019t excuse her from being an AH for expressing it or for attempting to tell you anything about naming your child. \n\nI don\u2019t know if her intention was to reconnect but if it was - it was done badly.

Wanting and insisting that his new wife and her kids visit your dying sister could have been about him showing your sister that her death wasn\u2019t going to leave him abandoned.  How else to explain the anger and hostility coming from him and his sending you away. You going elsewhere was him abandoning you before you too could desert him.

His behaviors taught you he had no empathy; no love.\n\nBut all that time you weren\u2019t in his life, he remained angry.  Pushing you away didn\u2019t solve his problem.  So he kept working it with his second wife and her family. Seems from what they said to you there was an expectation that one day you would want all of them to be your family.  Where did that come from after all that no contact time.  Why were they expecting you to need them after you had a baby.  \nGuessing your dad has changed me to realize he screwed up.

Yes ur sister had the right to choose who she allowed or not, I feel for the half sibs as it wasn\u2019t their choice to be born and it sounds like ur sister (and maybe u too?) had (still have?) issues with them just because they were born and ur dad moved on from ur mom (I could be wrong!). BUT their reaction to u naming ur daughter and blaming it as pain on them is absolutely BS. Sadly it\u2019s probably because of ur dad and step mom that they believe that as that\u2019s what they would have been taught i believe so please do try and consider that fact when dealing with the sibs. Do set ur boundaries and be firm on them though! They need to respect them and u can name ur child whatever u want and they do not get a say", "Most definitely NTA. Now you did say some hateful things to your father but that reaction from him is horrible. The great thing is that you choose to have whoever you want in your life and if they aren\u2019t on the list then that\u2019s their problem and not yours.", "It sounds like you were more than firm, you were a bit angry (but not much) in your response. That's okay though - they went angry first and were crossing major boundaries here.\n\nCongrats on your new family addition!", "I dont get some of these posts, you are very clearly nta and your father is a real f* piece of work", "People that make a tragic teenage death all about themselves are absolutely disgusting. Your sister is a painful memory for them? And your baby simply being named after a flower she loved is a trigger for them? they can fuck right off. She was your damn twin. And the way your father can throw away and replace family like that is also sick.", "[removed]", "I don't think that it matters what anyone told the half siblings. Anyone with an ounce of decency and compassion wouldn't act in that manner.", "Let\u2019s not forget they let a grudge against a dead girl fester for nine years.", "Yeah clearly they've been media stalking OP--probably for years.", "This is perfect", "His dad decided and implanted that truth in his children' spirit. The oldest was 8 and is now 16, still pretty normal to believe whatever shit her father's feeds her.", "You really gonna blame a dying teenager for not wanting people who she doesn't consider family near her on her final days alive? Jesus I'd argue there's something wrong with you.", "Your father wanted her to die alone, without visitors? That's horrible", "If the question is ever \u2018who is the asshole, a teenager literally on their deathbed or someone else\u2019, it\u2019s going to be the other person. I don\u2019t care if the dying teenager is screaming nazi shit at a black doctor, just give them space to die their own way and make your peace with it after. \n\nYour dad desperately needs years of therapy but that\u2019s his problem. And his kids have spent years being poisoned against you, and you\u2019ll probably never have a relationship with them. You owe them nothing, but if there is any part of you that would like something to do with that part of the family, just keep your mind open to speaking to them when they\u2019re adults and maybe have had time to see their father for who he really is.", "Totally true, but don't miss the commenter's point that your half-siblings are also victims of this situation. That doesn't mean it's acceptable for them to act that way or mean you can't respond properly, but try to remember that the only view they probably have of you and your sister is the one your father created for them. Manipulation is **powerful**, especially when it comes from someone you trust and believe-in. They probably have never had a reason to believe he's full of it.", "Bad bot. Comment stolen from [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/XW0tSQnGQ9).", "Yes, I really am. Because she was being needlessly cruel to her half-siblings, who knew her their entire lives, and who she had eight fucking years to develop even a tiny amount of consideration for.\n\nI am sick of this subreddit deciding that it's always okay to be a jerk to half siblings and step siblings. She could have let them in to say goodbye ONE time.\n\nYes, the dad is a much, much larger asshole, and the 16 y/o who contacted OP is bigger than the OP's twin was, but OP's twin still did Asshole behavior.", "It\u2019s worse than that.  Dad wanted to force OP\u2019s sister to see people on her death bed that she didn\u2019t want to see.  When OP\u2019s sister failed to comply with her father\u2019s demands. he tried to prohibit her from seeing anyone.  \n\nTruly a monster.", "Ok, but in all fairness the half-siblings are teenagers now, they should know better than to blame other people who were also teenagers at the time vs their father, who was an adult . . .", "Well, to be fair the MINOR reached out first.  Honestly, I think OP should have just blocked the ....person right from the get go.  What should OP care about what a bunch of strangers think?  And they are strangers, as per her former 'dad.'\n\nNTA.  Although maybe just forget them permanently?", "Yes he is", "Depends on what the father has been telling them. Could very well be telling them lies to dirty the relationship", "Doesnt matter. My sister has to deal with the fallout of her partners(DB) father spewing lies in his ears his entire life about his mother.. my niece has never met her paternal grandmother because of the things DB has grown up hearing about his mother. His mother and my mother are friends & co-workers who spent many days together when not working.. my mom cant even talk about my niece around her because it hurts her so much that she doesnt get to meet her granddaughter. Oh, and my sister ALSO works with both my mother and DBs mother on the same floor at the local hospital, so its something thats always just in the background for them.\n\nA lifetime of propaganda works on people all the time, and its almost assured when the propaganda is coming from someone you love and trust.. just because those kids are teens doesnt mean they've had a reason to reevaluate what they know, or would even accept that they're in the wrong. Whats more stubborn than a teen who thinks they know all the facts?", "If dear dad ever does reach out and wants to play happy family she could remind him that she isn\u2019t welcome in his family per his words since she was 17 years old. She could also say that he isn\u2019t her dad and hasn\u2019t been in a long time, also per his words.", "This sending in of flying monkeys, is typical for a narcissist (the father) when their actions & insane behaviour is getting exposed.\n\nExpose them all!\n\nThis ridiculous attack is to ruin the beautiful moment of your daughter being born and forever stay linked to it. This to try to create a trauma bond so that people in their confusion & pain and trying to understand, keep giving them their focus and energy for a long time to come.\n\nHope OP makes sure that these narcs, have absolutely no place nor any meaning for her and her daughter.", "The half siblings\u2019 parents could have handled this situation much better.  They must have been feeding their children a steady stream of poison for the last nine years.\n\nAll they needed to do was accept OP\u2019s sister\u2019s decision and not make a huge deal out of her not wanting to see her step mom or half sibling.  Instead, they chose to make it the defining issue of their lives.  NTA.  Your Dad\u2019s a monster."]}
