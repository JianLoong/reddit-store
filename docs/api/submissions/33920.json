{"id": 33920, "submission_id": "18stnqt", "title": "AITA for questioning my son why his fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t visit us?", "selftext": "I\u2019m 63 year old single mother of 3.  Wondering why there\u2019s such a disconnect with my son and future DIL. My oldest son (30) has been with his now fianc\u00e9e for 7 years. They met in the city I currently live in, and moved out of state 3 years ago. Her father lives in the same city as me so when they do visit time is usually split. When they first met she was over all the time, everyday in fact. She would spend holidays with us, spend the night all the time. My son lived with me until he was 23. The only negative experience that ever happened was between my youngest daughter (at the time 16) along with my son and his fianc\u00e9e. There was a big fallout for over a year. They all reconciled, and they began coming around again.\n Once they decided to move out of state I never see them. They\u2019re not even married yet and every holiday is spent with her family. When they come to town my son and her will visit, but she leaves to spend the night at her dads while my son spends the night at my house alone. I get them wanting to spend time with family separately, but in the last 3 years she hasn\u2019t spent more than 2 hours visiting us, and she won\u2019t spend the night even when I\u2019ve insisted she\u2019s welcome. This kinda leaves my son sad upon visiting, and then surely leaves my house to go to her dads. \n\nBoth my adult children still live with me. My son (26) has severe ADHD, and my daughter (21) and grandson (2) also live with me. Yes, I have a full house, but they\u2019ve always had their own bedroom upon visiting. It does cross my mind that maybe she judges how me and my family live, and how we do things, but she\u2019s still with my son. Me or none of my kids are married, or have a college degree, but they\u2019ll be the first married in our family, and she basically has the better career. I\u2019m bringing up these things because they are the main differences I can deeply think of. Her and I don\u2019t have much in common other than my son, they don\u2019t have kids, but plan to. She\u2019s polite and I don\u2019t have an issue with her, but she is showing signs of wanting nothing to do with us. I have asked my son if she\u2019s mad at us, or what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s always an excuse. \u201cShe\u2019s not feeling well\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s studying\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s busy\u201d every time. I told him I sensed BS and how its a shame whatever she has against us, is affecting his relationship with everyone else. I told him to strongly consider if he wants to marry her and bring kids into this situation. He\u2019s been upset with me since. AITA?\n\n**EDIT     I just wanted to put out that I completely understand when they visit they split up. It\u2019s just very hard to see them as a couple for 7 years spend time together with all sides of her family along with seeing pictures online of them happy together, but not witness that bond in person like her family gets from them. Then there\u2019s me who only sees her 2-4 hours out of the year, while my son visits alone and I can tell he wants her there. I would hate to see this situation if they had kids. Not that I don\u2019t want them to get married. As far as my daughter- My son did show me some comments that were made online or through text at the time this happened. They were a couple years in dating (didn\u2019t live with each other yet) and it was so early to know what to do. Had I known 7 years later they\u2019d be engaged I would of probably handled it differently. I did punish my daughter, but didn\u2019t go as far as having a conversation with everybody. 5 years has passed and I just don\u2019t see bringing it up now? I just feel I had to summarize that better.

You keep on mentioning 'visit' and 'visiting' as if that's an obvious thing to do.\n\nWhat's there to do in your house? What do you talk about? Are nice meals involved? Do you ask them what they'd want to do when they are in their hometown?\n\nI live away from my family and on the rare occasions when I go to visit it's all about them and zero about me. Even when I actually have plans and things I want to do/eat etc they simply ignore me and just do exactly what they want. It's exhausting. Makes me want to visit less and less.", "Nah. But if you want a better relationship with her why don\u2019t you ask her to spend some time with you to bond? Take her out for a meal and get to know her properly. It sounds like she isn\u2019t comfortable around you.", "YTA\n\nI don't understand the issue.  Of course, I try reading between the lines because you left out a lot.  You have two adult kids living with you and a grandchild.  None of them are staying there because they need help a short while, they never launched and are just living there.  It has nothing to do with college, it has a lot to do with the dynamic.  \n\nI came from a family with two parents in the home, and my ex-husband did also, when we came to visit from out of state, we *both* always stayed at my family's home and visited his family.  No one fussed, it was a good time.  All the kids came to visit also, none of us still lived with our parents.  His fianc\u00e9 could feel uncomfortable sleeping at your house with all the other people there too.  They are not guests, it's their home.  If her parents have an empty house the choice is obvious, but your son needs to stay with his fianc\u00e9.  \n\nWhy are you feeling sleeping at your house is so important?  Your son and FDIL **does** visit, why don't you count the few hours as visits?  Kids are supposed to grow up and move away.  It's the natural progression, are you so overbearing or enabling that your other two children didn't want to leave?  You were making excuses for them, but ADHD is not a reason not to launch. Having a child at 19 is also not a reason to not launch.  I had a child at 19 and already had a home, my daughter had a child at 17 and she has her own place at 18.  None of my children stayed at my house past 19, (I have six) My daughter that moved across the country visited once every year or two, and it was always wonderful, there was no discussion about where she slept or why she only comes once in two years, we are happy for the visit.  OP, what is really going on in your house.  \n\nI wonder if it is time for you OP to find yourself and rediscover who you are as a woman and not just as a mother.  Find friends, a hobby, something that is for just you.  That way you can allow your children to be adults that have their own lives.", "YTA. You haven't said anything positive about her or really even said if you like her or not. Only that she used to come over a lot. You have however mentioned reasons why you think she's judging YOU. Have you considered that as a single mom you're overly attached to your kids? Maybe she feels like your relationship is too enmeshed and she doesn't want to be anything more than civil. Also as an adult woman I wouldn't want to have sleepovers at my husband's mom's house", "NAH based on what you've shared, but this post screams of missing information.

They visit twice a year even though they live far away. They are polite to you. Your son still spends the night at your place.\n\nI understand you don\u2019t like the boundaries they set.  The way you get closer to someone is to meet them where they are and show that you can respect their boundaries. You did the opposite: you pushed and pressured and disrespected their boundaries and their relationship.", "Yta for telling son to not marry her or have kids with her.

But I can understand that it hurts to see them do better with her family", "For context, OP explained the fallout between her daughter and the fiancee in two comments - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18stnqt/comment/kf9iywr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18stnqt/comment/kf9mkne/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Still not a ton of information, but from the sounds of it, her daughter was the aggressor in the situation and I'm guessing said some pretty shitty stuff. OP also sounds willing to excuse her daughter's behavior because of age, even though 16 is plenty old enough to understand that words hurt and actions should have consequences. \n\nHaving been there before with my own SIL, I can tell you that - depending on what was said - a true reconciliation is often impossible. Once certain things are said, that's pretty much \"it\" on the relationship, and there's an ocean of difference between forgiving someone who has deeply hurt you and forgetting the hurt enough to actually continue a close relationship moving forward. \n\nIt doesn't take much to see that this is likely what's happened here, and is probably at least some of the reason why your SIL spends the bare minimum of time at your house, especially if she also picked up on the seeming fact that you never held your daughter accountable for being so cruel to another person that it caused the person to go no-contact for an entire year. \n\nAside from all of this, it sounds awful to spend the night with a packed house full of people - especially if one of the people has made her feelings about me CRYSTAL clear in the past. I completely understand why she doesn't spend the night. \n\nIt was beyond out-of-line to say what you did to your son.

Others are willing to create a bond, but when it fails for whatever reason they don't go out of their way to fix it and are just fine with being cordial but don't need the closeness at any price.

You like them and they like you, all goes well, you feel welcome at their house. Then a falling out happens. One member of the group becomes hostile. You are able to fix it, but the initial trust and friendly feelings get a big bumb and are mostly gone. And bc they are all so close and know each other for so long, you oc not only get distant from the one member of the group, but all of them, bc in the end they will always be on each others side. Now you usually would just look for other friends you feel comfortable around, bc why try to fit in a group you don't fully trust anymore?

Can't you understand this?\n\nSince the problematic member of the group (your daughter) is still living with you, she is always present when your dil visits. \n\nWhat you can do:\n- accept your daughter and dil will never be close or friends again (except smthg happens that leads them to bond on their own, but you will not be able to force it and should stay out of it)\n- surprise your dil with a nice activity for only you and her to share when she visits next (like getting your nails done or something, ask your son for the funds if you can't afford it, make sure its doable in the usual 2h she stays)\n- act like a friend, not like her mil. Try to get to know her like you would with a new coworker. Try to find shared interests. Do not talk about your son as your son, talk about her SO like you would about a friends SO. \n- when the activity is done and you had fun, offer her to go for a drink or a small lunch, if she enjoyed the time with you, she will agree. \n- don't push her for coming over to the house more often, just treat her like a new friend and let her come around on her pace. This way you can build up trust and friendship again and over time, if all goes well she will feel mord comfortable coming to your house, bc she feels welcome around you again. \n- accept she will may never feel fully comfortable around the other members of your household anymore and always prefer spending the night at her familys. But as long you and her are able to build up a bond and sincere friendship, this shouldn't matter.", "YTA for suggesting they break up and your total denial of his and her experience of his siblings and your dynamic with them.

Wondering why there\u2019s such a disconnect with my son and future DIL. My oldest son (30) has been with his now fianc\u00e9e for 7 years. They met in the city I currently live in, and moved out of state 3 years ago. Her father lives in the same city as me so when they do visit time is usually split. When they first met she was over all the time, everyday in fact. She would spend holidays with us, spend the night all the time. My son lived with me until he was 23. The only negative experience that ever happened was between my youngest daughter (at the time 16) along with my son and his fianc\u00e9e. There was a big fallout for over a year. They all reconciled, and they began coming around again.\n Once they decided to move out of state I never see them. They\u2019re not even married yet and every holiday is spent with her family. When they to town my son and her will visit, but she leaves to spend the night at her dads while my son spends the night at my house alone. I get them wanting to spend time with family separately, but in the last 3 years she hasn\u2019t spent more than 2 hours visiting us, and she won\u2019t spend the night even when I\u2019ve insisted she\u2019s welcome. This kinda leaves my son sad upon visiting, and then surely leaves my house to go to her dads. \n\nBoth my adult children still live with me. My son (26) has severe ADHD, and my daughter (21) and grandson (2) also live with me. Yes, I have a full house, but they\u2019ve always had their own bedroom upon visiting. It does cross my mind that maybe she judges how me and my family live, and how we do things, but she\u2019s still with my son. Me or none of my kids are married, or have a college degree, but they\u2019ll be the first married in our family, and she basically has the better career. I\u2019m bringing up these things because they are the main differences I can deeply think of. Her and I don\u2019t have much in common other than my son, they don\u2019t have kids, but plan to. She\u2019s polite and I don\u2019t have an issue with her, but she is showing signs of wanting nothing to do with us. I have asked my son if she\u2019s mad at us, or what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s always an excuse. \u201cShe\u2019s not feeling well\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s studying\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s busy\u201d every time.

You say they never visit, then complain that they visit but she doesn't stay the night? Sounds like you can't even decide what you're really upset about. If she doesn't feel comfortable sleeping at your house that's not a big deal. But telling your son he should rethink marrying her and having kids? That's awful. You don't know if there is even actually a problem, let alone what it is to be giving him advice to break off his engagement. Your job is to remain welcoming and supportive. Let them decide what relationship you all have. If it remains welcoming, things will likely change in time and you'll see them more. But they live in another state.

I think you're completely failing to see how big of an issue trying to break them up was - and asking your son to reconsider the engagement is, at the very least, adding fuel to the fire (so, yes, YTA). The fianc\u00e9e has zero ties to you or anyone in that house other than through your son - no surprise she takes a \"not going where I'm not wanted\" position in response to someone in your household trying to break them up - and not completely, as she does visit sometimes.

My point is, if you want a good relationship with your future DIL, you massively shot yourself in the foot by playing Switzerland when your daughter went on the offensive and you did it again basically asking your son to break up (even if you sugar-coat it as \"asking him to consider\").

You say anything about his girlfriend you will eventually lose him. \n\nWTF lady? You asked your son to reconsider marrying the woman he loves. \n\nSide note: maybe you should have involved yourself. Your daughter created this situation and you sat back did nothing. Of course this girl is going to think yo were ok with how she was treated.", "So what on earth are you confused about? Your daughter was (probably still is) a jerk and your son's fiancee understandably wants to keep her distance. \"Reconciled\" doesn't necessarily mean \"we're all best friends now.\" She can tolerate a few hours a year with your family. Obviously she isn't going to want to sleep in a house where she's uncomfortable. YTA for telling your son he should reconsider marrying or having a family with her, but you're a bigger asshole for pretending you have no idea why she wouldn't want to be around all of you.", "Your daughter shared things she didn\u2019t like about girlfriend with who exactly?", " Why would you stay out of your teen daughter's behavior? She's your responsibility.", "Then, continue staying out of it. If you had no control or knowledge of what your brat did that was hurtful enough to cut off contact back then, why would you poke your nose in your daughter in law's schedule now? Your son's in laws are obviously more pleasant and polite to be around, that's why they spend more time with them. No one owes you their spare time and affection. The time to parent was years ago. You should have done it then.", "Yeah, if someone \"shares\" all the things they don't like about me, I may eventually agree to be civil with them, but I'm not spending more time in their house than I absolutely have to, and I'm not forgiving or forgetting. \n\nYour daughter lives with you, so you're a package deal - and on top of that, you didn't get involved so DIL could easily assume or feel that you must share those opinions.\n\nYou can't stay out of things like this if you want to repair the relationship.", "This sounds like the missing reasons right here. Your daughter had no place doing that to a guest in your home.", "sounds like youre the one thats avoided", "OPs kids minus the one getting married still live with her. That level of codependency usually means everyone knows everyone else's business, especially the family matriarch. OP is conveniently leaving a lot of info out.", "Yeah...if it's my 16yr old...I know as much as I can.", "If my child was involved an argument that was severe enough to result in another child going no contact with them and me for a year, yeah, I\u2019d want to know what exactly was said.", "No OP knows. They just don\u2019t want to be honest.", "That, or it's not pestering to leave so much as \"hey, dinner is gonna be at 6. Are you going to make it in time?\" (Because they need to know how much food to cook) or \"we're going to go see a movie, it's 3 hours long. Are you going to be at your mom's until then?\" (Because they don't want to lock son out of the house) type of things. \n\nCould also just be pestering. Could be prearranged, could be something the son is trying to get fiancee to stop doing. OP has no clue which and isn't giving us context as to what the texts actually say.", "One of my husband\u2019s brother in laws made a comment about me being an outsider in the family. That was the day I quit making an effort to be part of the family.", "Similar situation with me.  I am very close to my family and hoped to be the same to my in-laws.  When my husband was mad at them and refused to go, I took my daughter to MIL\u2019s house until my husband was ok again.  However when my SIL was rude and disrespectful to me (after staying at our house for more than a year) and they didn\u2019t say anything, I also looked at all their past actions and I decided to just stick with basic civility.  I didn\u2019t say anything because the drama wasn\u2019t worth it.  OP - ask your son as he probably knows.  However, if your fDIL has checked out of her relationship with you all, then you must be prepared to make considerable efforts or just get used to status quo.", "edit: whoops, got my threads swapped around.", "There's also the suggestion that the son rethink the engagement because fianc\u00e9 isn't doing what OP expects now despite the history. OP is reaping what she sowed 5 years ago, fianc\u00e9's feelings weren't a priority then so OP and her family aren't a priority now. In the same situation I'd also fulfil the bare minimum responsibilities of showing up for a couple of hours before going somewhere I actually feel welcome. They may have overcome the issues with the sister but I'm not sure I would trust them or build a relationship with them like I would an in-law that hadn't done that including the rest of the family who didn't call out the silly 16 y/o. \n\nThe living situation also isn't ideal but that's very likely something that most people could deal with for a few days/a week. I don't think the lifestyle/economic/education/relationship choices are significant factors in the fianc\u00e9 avoiding the family.", "Because it was nothing but highschool drama between HER daughter and HER son and a girl he had been dating for a little while lol! She's a single mother raising 3 kids and one is special needs, im sure she was far more worried about paying her bills and providing for her family over inserting herself into and sorting out teenage drama with some girl she didn't even know would last longer than a month. And if girlfriend is still pissed that she wasn't treated as a priority at that point then not only are her world views very narrow minded then again she wouldn't be someone I'd want my family marrying either. \nMaybe she does distance herself from his family because of teenage drama and her MILs lack of assertiveness of the situation in either case it doesn't look like son is leaving the relationship anytime soon and if that is the case MIL should cut her losses because she ain't missing much from having that relationship with this girl.", "The fact that she went from \"I don\u2019t know what was said\" to \"actually I do know a few things that were said\" while still avoiding saying what her daughter actually said says a lot. OP knows exactly  why FDIL doesn't feel comfortable around them, and either she's still hoping FDIL would go away or is too cowardly to address the issue to try to mend fences.", "Now you're just arguing semantics because I don't fully agree with the verdict you do lol. I stated my reasons for my thoughts on the situation and left it at that. I'm not sure why you even felt the need to respond lol. But thanks for putting the energy out there \u2764\ufe0f", "I'd feel the same if the timeline wasn't a 5 year difference and MIL suggestion didn't come from DIL behavior over the last 5 years. If both happened at the same time or back to back then I'd fully agree with that!", "Essentially they were saying that every 20s years old that lives with their family is a loser and that OP and her family are all losers for being like that and poor. And that the reason the son is Never there is because they are poor and losers.", "Autocorrect. Should have read \"fdil\"", "The son visits 2x per year but gets pressured after an hour by fiance to leave. \"in the last 3 years she hasn\u2019t spent more than 2 hours visiting us\"", "Exactly what it is. \n\nDaughter thought she could be rude with no consequences. Perhaps thought the brother would drop the girlfriend.\n\nOP stayed out of it because she was ok with the daughter being rude to the girlfriend. \n\nNow the girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to come around and OP is upset at the obvious consequences of their own actions.", "Or the DIL is unbearable and the 16 yr old told her to knock it off. Could be any of these", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I don't think so.", "Did you tell your parents everything (like EVERYTHING) when you were 16? I don't think so.", "[deleted]", "thank you.  that isn't an american perspective though...I lived with my parents til my mid 20's to help out and save money.  didn't move out til I was getting married.", "Or maybe he chooses to leave and OP is putting the blame on the wrong party.", "We don\u2019t really know if he\u2019s getting pressured to leave. \n\nAnd have you not thought about the fact that the SIL is also visiting her own parents?\n\nIf I had the option to sleep at my parents or boyfriends mums house, of course I\u2019d choose my own parents house to sleep over at. \n\n**And** OP doesn\u2019t visit her son. How the heck is that the son\u2019s fault?\n\nNope, we\u2019re not really getting any details from OP. Which is why I think there\u2019s a lot of missing reasons here that OP leaves out on purpose to look better.", "This tracks imo. My in laws talk poorly about me behind my back although totally normal to my face so I don\u2019t come around unless I have to either", "She is really worried that she won't get to see the son's future kids.", "Then OP should be glad that DIL isn't making herself at home with the rest of her grown-ass kids.", "OP not knowing what happened is the problem.\nShe should have got involved the moment her 16yo created a rift.", "OP definitely knows what happened. Her daughter was 16 at the time, and it caused a year-long falling out. She just doesn't want to say what happened because if she did, it would be completely clear why FDIL doesn't hang around anymore.", "OP said in the replies that \"My daughter shared things she didn\u2019t like about her. \"\n\nTelling your sibling's partner what you don't like about them is generally rude at worst and awkward at best and creates a rift.\n\nWe also know that whatever was said was significant enough to create  \"big fallout for over a year\". \n\nWe also know that the fiancee doesn't care to spend much time over there anymore. \n\nIt's really not hard to put two and two together.", "When a 16 yo has caused an argument that results in other children going no contact it would be negligent of OP not to get to the bottom of it.\nOP is responsible for the actions of her minor children.", "Husband\u2019s sister\u2019s husband", "Husband's sibling's husband is husband's brother in law as well.", "Then the son needs to communicate. OP is operating on the info she has. But I doubt it's just the son based on the fact that FDIL doesn't like to visit.", "We don't know, but if the son doesn't communicate, neither will OP. The FDIL doesn't need to sleep over, but if she doesn't visit at all or spends almost no time visiting, it's kind of a flag. Also, OP sounds like she's got less disposable income. It's not the son's fault, but not hers either.", "I suspect OP knows the real reasons, even if she doesn't want to admit them (likely to herself as much as anyone).\n\nLooking at timeframe, OP says the son has been with his fianc\u00e9e for 7 years, and that she used to come over and stay all the time (before he moved out). But she also said he moved out at 23 and is now 30. Which is also 7 years ago.\n\nSo, the son moved out within a year of starting to date his fianc\u00e9e. Possibly to move in with her. (Though I'm not sure if it really matters whether he moved in with her immediately or not.)\n\nOP doesn't say exactly when the fianc\u00e9e stopped coming around much. But does admit to a big falling out with the younger sister that caused the son and fianc\u00e9e to stop visiting for over a year. A little math on the sister's age says that the falling out was 5 years ago. Which means the reconciliation was 4 years ago. Maybe less.\n\nThe son and fianc\u00e9e moved out of state 3 years ago. The fianc\u00e9e had clearly stopped visiting more than minimally at that point.\n\nBut I suspect it was really earlier than that. Given that the falling out was apparently about the younger sister telling the fianc\u00e9e \"what she didn't like about her\", I doubt the fianc\u00e9e came around much even after the reconcilliation. If she even came around much after the son moved out.\n\nHonestly, it's likely that the blow-up with the younger sister was probably the culmination of a string of incidents. Incidents where the fianc\u00e9e may have felt less than fully welcome in the home for a while already.\n\nIt is also notable there that OP is like \"I don't really know what the issue was about\" and \"I was staying out of it\". Staying out of it to such a degree that her son cut contact for more than a year. Given the current state of affairs, the \"I'm staying out of it\" probably translates to \"I agreed with my daughter, I just didn't say so publicly\". It's one of the best explainations for her willingness to allow the issue to go on as long as it did and not step in.\n\nMy suspicion is that the son himself has been slowly distancing himself from his family for years. That if OP would stop focusing on the fianc\u00e9e and focus on her own relationship with her son, and that of her other kids with him, she'd know exactly why he's doing so.", "Hey we have the same in laws!!", "Yeah, \"fdil is unbearable\" doesn't track, since OP wants to see her more. \n\nBut this would be easily answered if OP just asked the person living in her house.", "And OP defends her daughter by saying she was overprotective", "That is a fight she is having with the daughter. There\u2019s no need to ice out the whole family because of it.", "[deleted]", "When the family allowed it to happen, there sure is a need.", "The daughter was 16, a child. OP should have stepped in and parented her kid. She chose to enable the bad behaviour instead of teaching her respect and manners. IMO OP is just as bad as her daughter to allow this. You don't get to just \"stay out of it\" and then act innocent when your minor child is picking fights.", "Yeah, I've seen that vary though. Particularly if the two people in question don't get along anyway. \n\nLike my sister is married, so am I. Our husbands would probably refer to the other as BIL. They get along though. \n\nMeanwhile, my best friend cannot STAND her husband's sister's husband (let's call him Todd). Like, at all. My friend does NOT refer to Todd as her BIL ever. Todd is her husband's BIL, and the father of her kids' cousins, but that's it. They tolerate each other when needed, mostly by simply existing in different rooms of the house, and that's all. \n\nSo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f probably just a cultural/personal difference."]}
