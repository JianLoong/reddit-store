In which case, he needs to be cut off and get back to life.\n\nIn either scenario, the result is the same - he needs to get back to living and working.", "NTA. At this point he\u2019s using it as an excuse. Has he gotten therapy?", "NTA - your husband is not just grieving, he's gone limp on life.  The therapy he's getting obviously isn't doing much good.  Grief is hard, but people have been dying and the survivors going on for quite a few years.  He needs to try harder in therapy and get back up and cope rather than expect you to carry him for the rest of his life. Anyone this incapacitated for this long is either malingering or should be inpatient on medication.", "I think he needs to see someone. It is of course perfectly reasonable for him to grieve, and he will be grieving forever. But it will significantly help his mental health if he has something to do and somewhere to go every day.\n\nSource: I'm a widow as of March last year. It sucks. It will always suck. I think it would be even worse to lose a child. I'm currently retraining to become a teacher, but my classes are on a break until February. I have noticed a definite difference in how I'm doing. Keeping busy helps me manage the grief. Doing something meaningful helps me feel better. I can't change the situation and neither can your husband; but it's not healthy to sit in grief for so long. Finding a job will give him a purpose, and we all need a purpose.", "NTA\n\nHe's had over 4 years to grieve.  At this point, he's using his daughter's death as an excuse to not work, which is extremely manipulative.\n\nIt might be worth consulting a Divorce Attorney in your area about what the process and possible outcomes of divorce would be.  Even if that's not a choice you want to make, right now, it's worth understanding your options.", "NTA\n\nI cannot imagine his loss, however, he's being a terrible partner to you. Best case scenario, he's still so mired in grief that he can't see that. Worst case scenario, he's using his grief as an excuse not to work. I think that a heart-to-heart about how unkind and unfair he is being to you will reveal which of these is the case. If it's grief, he needs a new therapist and a new job. If it's an excuse, you need a divorce attorney.", "NTA...I lost my daughter in 2019. I took a month off and returned to work. Yes my world ended when she passed but life did not. I've seen therapist but ultimately I can't ignore responsibilities permanently because of grief.", "I would have probably framed it differently. Whatever you said can't be unsaid, but you can definitely revisit and acknowledge that you're feeling bad about how the conversation went. There can be multiple reasons for you wanting him to get a job: to help financially, as well as to get him back on his feet and feeling better after a traumatic experience. Both are valid. He may need some help getting to the point of going back to work, but research says the best thing he can do after a traumatic experience is to find a sense of normalcy in his life. For some people, that's easier said than done. You can help him find what he needs to get there because it sounds like after 5 years it's not going to be self-initiated.", "NTA- although I'm curious as to how this will fall. In another post recently the people decided that grief trumped poor behavior.  \n\nINFO: has he sought help? because half a decade is way too long to be shutdown. He has to recognize that allowing grief to literally shut him down for that long is not healthy and he should want to find a way to become functional. If he refuses help and refuses to do anything- then you have to decide what you can live with.", "NTA. You've been very compassionate. Unfortunately the world doesn't stop turning when someone we love dies. Maybe he starts with something just part time, he can ease back into it. I hope he is in therapy. There are also lots of grief support groups, loss of children support groups, social media communities, etc.", "NTA he is going to grieve forever, but he needs to work.", "NTA for feeling how you do.\n\nYour husband should have sought out a better therapist or an additional support group to help overcome his grief.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you warned him about the real world consequences of him not working - he\u2019ll have to grieve his daughter while being homeless and without a regular source of food. Sometimes a jolt is needed for people to come out of their limbo", "NTA I suffered a very traumatic loss in 2020 and to say I\u2019m not still grieving would be a lie but it definitely is easier with time and therapy. Do I think I\u2019m able to function the way I did before? Hard no, am I trying my best? Definitely. First steps are the hardest and then you just keep moving. Loss never goes away and some wounds never completely heal but he still has you in his life and if doesn\u2019t take that first step he could lose that too.", "NTA.  Bereavement leave is days or weeks, not years. If he legitimately can't work he should be pursuing disability or other benefits, but it sounds like won't instead of can't. \n\nIs it possible to get him volunteering to build up his confidence as he transitions back to work? I used to do employment counseling and my clients who were long term unemployed were usually scared. Volunteering helped some of them rediscover work habits and routine and gave them more confidence. \n\nA grief support group might help as well, especially when he realizes he's the only one who has gotten this much time off to grieve. Things can be easier to hear from a peer group.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He will always grieve his daughter.  There will be good periods but there will be times where it will hit him like a brick.  This is called life and at times it sucks.\n\nHow long have you been together?  Have you got any kids together?\n\nHe really needs to pull his socks up.  If you were saying this after 6-12 months I'd say you were a bit harsh.  But 5 years later..... he's gotten very used to this.  He may need to desensitise himself to working again.  Is he able to pick up something part time or even some volunteer work to get himself started?\n\nIf nothing is improving you need to decide whether you are okay with doing this for the rest of your life together or whether something needs to give.\n\nThere is only so much another person can do but ultimately it's up to your husband to get motivated.  You can certainly help him but you can't do it for him.", "NTA.

I think he is scared because he has not worked in such a long time. He thinks cooking and cleaning our home is enough. It was but not anymore. We have been very blessed with our living situation but it no longer an option with how expensive everything is now. I have told him if I get sick we are Homeless.", "Would his daughter want him to be stuck in this, not moving forward in his life because he's so preoccupied on her? That's what the grieving process is for, processing the loss and being able to move forward. He doesn't have to forget her, but he shouldn't be holding himself back.", "Thanks. It's hard! But I know, for instance, the four weeks I was doing student teaching, I felt so much better. I was in a pretty rough school, I was called a f$&#ing c#&+ almost every day, but even so, just knowing I was expected somewhere, that I had an obligation to be there - it really helped. It gave me a reason to get out of bed. It's so easy to just sit in the sadness, but it's not healthy. Your husband would benefit from finding a job, even if it's just part-time doing something simple. \n\nNow that placement is over I just rely on the fine folks at Reddit to call me a f+$&ing c&-$ instead!", "That\u2019s not how math is done.", "OP should be v careful about wording it like that, though - using his dead daughter's supposed wishes to argue for what she, the OP, wants can come across as manipulative, whether it's true or not."]}
