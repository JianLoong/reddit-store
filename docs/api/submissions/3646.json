In which case, he needs to be cut off and get back to life.\n\nIn either scenario, the result is the same - he needs to get back to living and working.", "NTA. At this point he\u2019s using it as an excuse. Has he gotten therapy?", "NTA - your husband is not just grieving, he's gone limp on life.  The therapy he's getting obviously isn't doing much good.  Grief is hard, but people have been dying and the survivors going on for quite a few years.  He needs to try harder in therapy and get back up and cope rather than expect you to carry him for the rest of his life. Anyone this incapacitated for this long is either malingering or should be inpatient on medication.", "I think he needs to see someone. It is of course perfectly reasonable for him to grieve, and he will be grieving forever. But it will significantly help his mental health if he has something to do and somewhere to go every day.\n\nSource: I'm a widow as of March last year. It sucks. It will always suck. I think it would be even worse to lose a child. I'm currently retraining to become a teacher, but my classes are on a break until February. I have noticed a definite difference in how I'm doing. Keeping busy helps me manage the grief. Doing something meaningful helps me feel better. I can't change the situation and neither can your husband; but it's not healthy to sit in grief for so long. Finding a job will give him a purpose, and we all need a purpose.", "NTA\n\nHe's had over 4 years to grieve.  At this point, he's using his daughter's death as an excuse to not work, which is extremely manipulative.\n\nIt might be worth consulting a Divorce Attorney in your area about what the process and possible outcomes of divorce would be.  Even if that's not a choice you want to make, right now, it's worth understanding your options.", "NTA\n\nI cannot imagine his loss, however, he's being a terrible partner to you. Best case scenario, he's still so mired in grief that he can't see that. Worst case scenario, he's using his grief as an excuse not to work. I think that a heart-to-heart about how unkind and unfair he is being to you will reveal which of these is the case. If it's grief, he needs a new therapist and a new job. If it's an excuse, you need a divorce attorney.", "NTA...I lost my daughter in 2019. I took a month off and returned to work. Yes my world ended when she passed but life did not. I've seen therapist but ultimately I can't ignore responsibilities permanently because of grief.", "I would have probably framed it differently. Whatever you said can't be unsaid, but you can definitely revisit and acknowledge that you're feeling bad about how the conversation went. There can be multiple reasons for you wanting him to get a job: to help financially, as well as to get him back on his feet and feeling better after a traumatic experience. Both are valid. He may need some help getting to the point of going back to work, but research says the best thing he can do after a traumatic experience is to find a sense of normalcy in his life. For some people, that's easier said than done. You can help him find what he needs to get there because it sounds like after 5 years it's not going to be self-initiated.", "NTA- although I'm curious as to how this will fall. In another post recently the people decided that grief trumped poor behavior.  \n\nINFO: has he sought help? because half a decade is way too long to be shutdown. He has to recognize that allowing grief to literally shut him down for that long is not healthy and he should want to find a way to become functional. If he refuses help and refuses to do anything- then you have to decide what you can live with.", "NTA. You've been very compassionate. Unfortunately the world doesn't stop turning when someone we love dies. Maybe he starts with something just part time, he can ease back into it. I hope he is in therapy. There are also lots of grief support groups, loss of children support groups, social media communities, etc.", "NTA he is going to grieve forever, but he needs to work.", "NTA for feeling how you do.\n\nYour husband should have sought out a better therapist or an additional support group to help overcome his grief.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you warned him about the real world consequences of him not working - he\u2019ll have to grieve his daughter while being homeless and without a regular source of food. Sometimes a jolt is needed for people to come out of their limbo", "NTA I suffered a very traumatic loss in 2020 and to say I\u2019m not still grieving would be a lie but it definitely is easier with time and therapy. Do I think I\u2019m able to function the way I did before? Hard no, am I trying my best? Definitely. First steps are the hardest and then you just keep moving. Loss never goes away and some wounds never completely heal but he still has you in his life and if doesn\u2019t take that first step he could lose that too.", "NTA.  Bereavement leave is days or weeks, not years. If he legitimately can't work he should be pursuing disability or other benefits, but it sounds like won't instead of can't. \n\nIs it possible to get him volunteering to build up his confidence as he transitions back to work? I used to do employment counseling and my clients who were long term unemployed were usually scared. Volunteering helped some of them rediscover work habits and routine and gave them more confidence. \n\nA grief support group might help as well, especially when he realizes he's the only one who has gotten this much time off to grieve.

I have told him if I get sick we are Homeless.", "Would his daughter want him to be stuck in this, not moving forward in his life because he's so preoccupied on her? That's what the grieving process is for, processing the loss and being able to move forward. He doesn't have to forget her, but he shouldn't be holding himself back.", "Thanks. It's hard! But I know, for instance, the four weeks I was doing student teaching, I felt so much better. I was in a pretty rough school, I was called a f$&#ing c#&+ almost every day, but even so, just knowing I was expected somewhere, that I had an obligation to be there - it really helped. It gave me a reason to get out of bed. It's so easy to just sit in the sadness, but it's not healthy.

He has to start a new life now with the lose that happened 5 years ago. Nothing can be undone but he has to learn to move on, of course not from his daughter but with the grieving stage. 5 years is enough maybe not but it can't be forever. Did I make sence?", "NTA. \n\nBut maybe you can frame it more as \"I need you. I need your help. I'm scared of not being able to pay the bills. Please, make a plan for how / when you can transition back into work. Maybe something part time to get back into mental work mode.\"\n\nIt's kind of inertia. When you're moving forward it's easy to keep moving forward. Once you stop, the longer you stay at a full stop indefinitely with no plan put into place first for when you'd need yo start moving again so you could mentally start preparing for it.... it becomes very hard to get motivated and get moving again. \n\nHe probably feels like his world stopped when he lost his daughter. But the world didn't stop. Bills still need to get paid. If he's waiting until the pain goes away, he'll be waiting forever. But he needs to move forward in spite of the pain. Working isn't going to make the pain worse. The pain is the pain. It will be his uncomfortable companion forever. Working doesn't mean he's gotten over it or that he isn't taking his daughter's loss seriously enough. He did, he is, and he always will. \n\nPlease assure him you're aware that going back to work won't mean everything is fine with him now. Moving forward with loss doesn't mean the pain is gone and you'll never assume this is something he can just \"get over\" at some point. But you love him too much to let him drop out of life, and you need him too much not to beg him to please try to get back into the workforce. \n\nGood luck. I'm so sorry for both of you dealing with the aftermath of this terrible grief. Don't give up on him, and don't let him give up on himself.", "NTA. Ten years ago, my sister lost both her beloved husband and daughter quite suddenly. It was a horrific time for her where her grief extracted excruciating pain from her physically and emotionally. She woke up each day, dreading the pain, and slept quite a bit to escape. She found a great therapist (which I think would be key to your husband moving forward). The best advice she got from therapy was to make a to-do list the night before so that she would have something to look forward to the next day. It was extremely difficult at first, and then it became a lifeline of sorts. She will always grieve, but now those to-do lists gave her a sense of normalcy, returning to living. She began doing volunteer work as an outlet to keep busy. She made homemade salsas and sold them at farmers' markets and craft shows. She does disappear quietly during their birthdays, which is normal. She is no longer with a therapist. From your post, I don't see your husband's therapist doing much for him...try to find another one. Also, does he have access to the state of your finances, since you say you can no longer carry the both of you?", "NTA.\nHe has a responsibility to the living. If this is the road he wants to take, explain to him that either he gets therapy and a job, or he can wallow in this situation on his own. \nYou can only tread water for so long before a dead weight drags you down, and he's dead weight.\nI'm not unsympathetic to his pain.

Grief is rough at the best of times, but losing a child is famously the worst kind of grief. There is no expectation that you\u2019ll outlive your own child and it\u2019s a sucker punch. My uncle lost his daughter to a car accident before I was even born, and he still thinks about her every day. \n\nThat said, he needs to learn how to function in the world while carrying this grief, because it will never go away and the world won\u2019t stop just because his did.", "Ian to see any fight or disagreement that could occur where you wouldn\u2019t recommend divorce?", "I just don't want to be homeless.

Barely.", "A couple of distant relatives of mine lost their only son in an accident before I was born, my mom said that even years later, when I was around 8 or 9 (so that would have been probably 10-15 years after the fact) she still got uncomfortable when she met this couple with me and my brother at like family events etc., because the mother kept looking at us looking absolutely destroyed.", "NTA, your frustration is valid.\n\nA parent who loses a child will never get over it. The grief is here to stay. But we learn to live with it.", "Did I sleep a WHOLE MONTH. Is it January 1 already!?!", "NTA what you said is accurate. He will never be \u2018over\u2019 the loss of his daughter.  There eventually comes a point where taking time to recover turns into exploiting her death as a way to get out of participating in life.", "NTA\n\nYou're right, that grief is unknowable for those who have never lost a child, but after five years, it's an excuse.

But he needs to stand up now he can't be grieving all his life make him understand that even his daughter was the most important thing it's gone, it's okay if he feels sad but he can't be stuck In his past forever he need start making his future too, ge has a life with you now and maybe in future he could have another daughter which gives another chance at life.", "I don't know if he's being manipulative, as some are suggesting, but it sounds like he's stuck and still numb and not even caring about how little you are surviving on, all signs of depression. Everyone grieves differently, but it sounds like he has a therapist who is not encouraging or motivating him to rejoin the living and move forward. You may want to seek a different therapist, perhaps recommend to him a grief support group. My sister did solo getaways to rejuvenate, recharge, and meditate. I wish I could be of more help and sincerely hope your husband gets the help he desperately needs in order to be more present in your lives.", "Nta I get he's hurting but you've been empathetic . He's the asshole for expecting you to bare the weight of both of you forever", "NTA you gave him time to Grieve but 5 years is too much pressure for you and has become a lifestyle for him, he needs to rejoin the real world and the responsibility that comes along with that.", "NTA If he's not in therapy, he should be. I lost my 22 year old son in 2014. In 2017 my doctor literally told me I would never be able to hold a job again due to my depression and anxiety and suggested I apply for disability. Maybe that's an option for your husband. For me, it was a wake up call. I went back to work and it saved my life. I'm off all meds. I keep my mind and body busy all day. No time to dwell on my problems and then I'm tired so I can actually sleep. Everyone's grief journey is different but clearly something has to change in your home. I'm very sorry for your family's loss and hope your husband finds a way through.", "NTA\nWallowing in misery for 5 years helps no one. Therapist asap.

From experience I can tell you staying home can become a vicious cycle. The pain of losing a child is indescribable and he may need to get on some antidepressants, but eventually things have to happen. My husband stayed home 6 weeks after we lost our son, anymore than that and he said it would become too hard to go back to work and eventually try to navigate a new normal (it sounds trite and I hate that phrase but it honestly is what it is).
