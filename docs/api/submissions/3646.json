Grief is hard, but people have been dying and the survivors going on for quite a few years.

I think it would be even worse to lose a child. I'm currently retraining to become a teacher, but my classes are on a break until February. I have noticed a definite difference in how I'm doing. Keeping busy helps me manage the grief. Doing something meaningful helps me feel better. I can't change the situation and neither can your husband; but it's not healthy to sit in grief for so long. Finding a job will give him a purpose, and we all need a purpose.", "NTA\n\nHe's had over 4 years to grieve.

I've seen therapist but ultimately I can't ignore responsibilities permanently because of grief.", "I would have probably framed it differently. Whatever you said can't be unsaid, but you can definitely revisit and acknowledge that you're feeling bad about how the conversation went. There can be multiple reasons for you wanting him to get a job: to help financially, as well as to get him back on his feet and feeling better after a traumatic experience. Both are valid. He may need some help getting to the point of going back to work, but research says the best thing he can do after a traumatic experience is to find a sense of normalcy in his life. For some people, that's easier said than done. You can help him find what he needs to get there because it sounds like after 5 years it's not going to be self-initiated.", "NTA- although I'm curious as to how this will fall.

Do I think I\u2019m able to function the way I did before? Hard no, am I trying my best? Definitely. First steps are the hardest and then you just keep moving. Loss never goes away and some wounds never completely heal but he still has you in his life and if doesn\u2019t take that first step he could lose that too.", "NTA.  Bereavement leave is days or weeks, not years. If he legitimately can't work he should be pursuing disability or other benefits, but it sounds like won't instead of can't. \n\nIs it possible to get him volunteering to build up his confidence as he transitions back to work? I used to do employment counseling and my clients who were long term unemployed were usually scared. Volunteering helped some of them rediscover work habits and routine and gave them more confidence. \n\nA grief support group might help as well, especially when he realizes he's the only one who has gotten this much time off to grieve.

But I know, for instance, the four weeks I was doing student teaching, I felt so much better. I was in a pretty rough school, I was called a f$&#ing c#&+ almost every day, but even so, just knowing I was expected somewhere, that I had an obligation to be there - it really helped.

Please, make a plan for how / when you can transition back into work. Maybe something part time to get back into mental work mode.\"\n\nIt's kind of inertia. When you're moving forward it's easy to keep moving forward. Once you stop, the longer you stay at a full stop indefinitely with no plan put into place first for when you'd need yo start moving again so you could mentally start preparing for it.... it becomes very hard to get motivated and get moving again. \n\nHe probably feels like his world stopped when he lost his daughter.

Ten years ago, my sister lost both her beloved husband and daughter quite suddenly. It was a horrific time for her where her grief extracted excruciating pain from her physically and emotionally. She woke up each day, dreading the pain, and slept quite a bit to escape. She found a great therapist (which I think would be key to your husband moving forward). The best advice she got from therapy was to make a to-do list the night before so that she would have something to look forward to the next day. It was extremely difficult at first, and then it became a lifeline of sorts. She will always grieve, but now those to-do lists gave her a sense of normalcy, returning to living. She began doing volunteer work as an outlet to keep busy. She made homemade salsas and sold them at farmers' markets and craft shows. She does disappear quietly during their birthdays, which is normal. She is no longer with a therapist. From your post, I don't see your husband's therapist doing much for him...try to find another one. Also, does he have access to the state of your finances, since you say you can no longer carry the both of you?", "NTA.\nHe has a responsibility to the living.

Everyone grieves differently, but it sounds like he has a therapist who is not encouraging or motivating him to rejoin the living and move forward.

I lost my 22 year old son in 2014. In 2017 my doctor literally told me I would never be able to hold a job again due to my depression and anxiety and suggested I apply for disability. Maybe that's an option for your husband. For me, it was a wake up call. I went back to work and it saved my life. I'm off all meds. I keep my mind and body busy all day. No time to dwell on my problems and then I'm tired so I can actually sleep. Everyone's grief journey is different but clearly something has to change in your home.

Coping mechanisms generally aren't healing mechanisms and can be jsut what you do to ensure you don't unalive yourself but they may be harmful or keep you suspended in your heavy, dark feelings. \n\nI'm still struggling to find ways to function when I get depressed (trauma related) and I can get myself through safely now, but sometimes I get too comfortable with coping (which is sometimes ignoring) difficult feelings which just makes them never go away. Usually what pulls me out fo it is something bad happens, things otherwise get worse, or a lived one is going through a rough time. \n\nSometimes you need to switch therapy as some grief and trauma counseling focuses too much in just letting the patient talk. It's important to feel heard and validated, and its expecially true in the beginning or with new revelations, but these types of therapy can sometimes not be structured or directed enough to benefit the patient. Sometimes this means sessions are just ranting and rumination and the therapist doesn't want to invalidate their patient so they don't redirect them... which is harmful to the patient long term. \n\nSometimes you need a proverbial shake or someone/something to help you regain perspective. The pain is still there and the hurt is there, but you never start ti process it if you refuse to sit with those feelings and convince yourself the trauma or loss has wrecked you and there's no hope. It's INCREDIBLY hard to do when depressed, and there's a good chance OPs husband is, but it's something you have ti do. Sometimes you don't even know how far down you've spiraled until someone in you life points out its hurting them in a valid way. People in this state are elikely to get defensive at first, but hopefully he'll calm down and be able to take a more objective look at OPs perspective soon.", "It is notoriously the AITA answer for everything. \n\nI admit in this instance it might have it's place.

Has he been to therapy?  Has he been diagnosed with mental health conditions that prevent him from working due to the grief?  Extreme grief can truly break a person, and make it difficult to move on, and if he's not had adequate mental health support, then he may not be ready. \n\nBut that doesn't mean you just sit at home and wallow, and expect everyone around you to pick up the slack forever. He needs to be moving forward towards getting himself together.  If he truly is unable to go back to work, what is he doing to get to the point where he is able?  Has he looked into disability benefits or what supports he can source to help you since you're shouldering everything without his income?  I have a family member who lost a son in 2017 and while he took some time off work, it was measured in weeks, not years.  A family friend lost her son in 2019 and she also went back to work within the year.

Everybody grieves differently, but at some point accepting what has happened and continuing on with your life has to be a part of that process.\n\nHas he seen a therapist?", "OP he needs counseling to deal with this.  You\u2019re NTA", "NTA - he\u2019s stuck in a loop and it\u2019s time to get out of it. Of course he\u2019ll always grieve and miss his daughter. But I suspect 5 years on he\u2019s not actively dealing with it.", "NTA. My son died in 2019. I still work. I grieve at night, crying my self to sleep. But I still do what needs to be done. Do I want to? No. Hope your situation improves.", "NTA, he\u2019s no longer grieving he\u2019s wallowing.", "NTA he needs to get off his butt and find a job", "Plus my loved one died 4 years ago . .and I still grieve them . I always will (have had therapy btw). Grief for someone close is normal. \n\nSo....is he planning on not working for the rest of his life or just till you stop bankrolling him? Cos he hasn't chosen the 3rd option. HE NEEDS TO....Get a job. Get a job. GET A JOB!!!!!!\n\nOther Grievers do."]}
