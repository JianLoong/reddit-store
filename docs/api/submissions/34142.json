If someone were to ask me if they could have something and I didn't want them having a certain kind, id say \" Sure, any but the _____\"", "~~I N F O: Did you know that coconut was her favorite, and was it clear that the one you took was the coconut one; i.e. was there a chart or something showing which chocolate had what filling?~~\n\nNTA then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I feel as though if she said yes to my request to eat a chocolate from her box of chocolates, that I should be okay to pick any one of the chocolates in there and eat it.\n\nThat isn't quite true. If you knew (or even if you should have known) that the coconut one was her favorite, you would have been an asshole for taking it, even if she *did* only say, \"help yourself\" when you asked her if you could have a chocolate. If you knew that it was her favorite, it would have been the loving thing to do to leave it for her.\n\nBut you *didn't* know, and she didn't tell you. You're not a mind reader. You're not the asshole for taking it, and she is for telling you that you were inconsiderate. How could you be considerate if she never told you coconut was here favorite?", "NTA, she didn't tell you not to eat that specific one", "NTA she said yes you took one. She needs to grow up", "YTA", "Well, if there was more information from \u201csomething along the lines of yes\u201d, then you may indeed be the AH. What does that mean? What did she say?\n\nIf you said yes directly and you didn\u2019t know what her favourite chocolate is then NTA.", "\u201cSomething along the lines of yes\u201d\u2026guessing was more like \u201cyes, but not the coconut one.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then YTA.", "INFO: What does \"something along the lines of yes\" mean? This implies that there WERE strings attached that you didn't listen to? Also, have you been dating long enough that you should have known what her favorite would be?", "I N F O: did you know it was her favorite when you chose it? Was it the only one?\n\nNTA: she\u2019s expecting you to be a mind reader. Not fair of her. She needs to use her words.", "Need to know more. This sentence seems so misleading it's hard to judge:\n\n>She said something along the lines of \"yes\"\n\nI mean, it so specifically avoids saying that she said \"yes\" that it leads one to thing you might be TA?", "I didn\u2019t know coconut was her favorite, and there was a chart on the bottom, but I just kinda glazed over them visually before picking one", "She said something like \"sure go ahead\", \"yeah that's fine\". I just worded it the way I did in the post because I couldn't remember her exact words.", "There were multiple coconuts, I didn\u2019t know it was her favorite", "She said something alone the lines of \u201csure go ahead\u201d or \u201cyeah that\u2019s fine\u201d. I just didn\u2019t want to put words in her mouth", "How long have you been together/known each other? I feel like if you\u2019ve been with her at least a year, you should probably have known she likes coconut and made sure to save them. Those boxes only have 1 or 2 of a flavor sometimes. I\u2019d be a bit upset if my partner took my only favorite chocolate on a rare time I had a box of them. I wouldn\u2019t freak out or sleep on the couch or anything extreme but I\u2019d be upset. I like maybe half of the chocolates in those box so I\u2019m usually excited for my favorite and then there\u2019s a couple others I\u2019m okay with. If she\u2019s the same, I can totally see why she\u2019s a little upset. Sometimes when you\u2019re gonna have one to your favorite treats, and it\u2019s just gone, it takes a bit for you to stop thinking about it since you were expecting and excited for it. NAH as long as she doesn\u2019t hold a grudge over it (aside from like, joking about it) and as long as you aren\u2019t being an A about her being upset about it and saying she\u2019s being stupid for being upset. You can and should have empathy for her and the fact you ate something she wanted, even if you had no idea.", "Then NTA. She can\u2019t expect you to be a mind reader.", "There were 3 coconuts in the box, and I ate the second one."]}
