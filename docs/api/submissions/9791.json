So this pregnancy we\u2019ve been extra cautious, and secretive.

With that I kind of just looked like I gained weight. \n\nWe were hesitant on me going, I was just going to send my husband with a gift of mine, but SIL said she really wanted me there. I decided to try my best to hide the bump and go.\n\nIt was all going well, no one noticed, I mean I got a few looks but no one asked me anything. Then about an hour in I started having tiny cramps, that eventually got more aggressive. I told my husband we need to leave I need to go to the hospital. As We we\u2019re walking a sharp pain hit me and I grabbed the picnic table next to me and almost stumbled over causing attention to myself. I really thought I was in labor, the pains were getting so intense. People started surrounding us, asking what was the matter and my husband says \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, guys she pregnant, something\u2019s goin on, we have to leave.\u201d He was panicked himself. He rushed me to the hospital.\n\n\nBy the time we got the hospital my pains had subsided, they said it was false labor. My husband and I both had angry texted messages from SIL and other guest at the party about us hiding the pregnancy,how messed up it was, and how they couldn\u2019t believe I showed up pregnant and was secret about it.

Your caution is understandable. Maybe your husband could have not dropped that bombshell that way, but he was rightfully concerned.\n\nYour SIL is a jerk for not even asking if you and the baby were OK. She wasn't in the wrong for feeling upset about her baby shower being derailed a bit, but she should have been more understanding, since you lost your other baby, since you were in pain.", "NTA. People aren't entitled to know about your pregnancy.", "Firstly, congratulations on your pregnancy and I am glad you and baby are both healthy.  That being said, in this instance YTA.  You are 8 months along, can go into labor any day, and it comes out at your SIL's baby shower?  That is extremely disrespectful.   I get why you kept it private in the beginning.  You should have told them before the shower and offered to not come if it would be an issue.", "ESH\n\nYou could have mentioned it privately to your SIL beforehand. I understand the fear after losing a child, but by the time you're in your 3rd trimester, your close family should probably know. Especially if you plan to attend someone else's baby shower.", "Oh NTA this is so shit of everyone. Nobody's damn business if you're pregnant or not and you didn't plan to have a scare at the baby shower!", "NTA. Baby stunt??? Said to someone who's suffered a stillbirth? Keep them all away til baby is here and you feel well enough to deal with them.", "ESH. Now of course, I am obviously unaware of your familial situation nor do I see it relevant to this story but your communication could've been so much better. You can't go to an event like this in the state you're in without the host and a few others knowing your situation. If you were in labour, it could've been so much worse. Not to mention that you probably stole all the attention off of SIL considering you left in such a dramatic way. I just don't think this was one of your brightest moments. However, I do think that SIL should've been a tad bit more understanding despite your, in my opinion, unwarranted secrecy. She probably felt hurt that you hadn't told her. I definitely think people are cutting you slack because you're pregnant. In conclusion, ESH but you're the major asshole.-", "NTA\nYou had reasons to keep it quiet.\nAnd even if you didn't have a specific reason, it's still your business to share, or not share. \nSiL wanted you to go, even though you didn't want to go.\n\nThis isn't the same as showing up to steal her thunder, with a purposeful pregnancy announcement. \n\n\nAs for the people who sent angry messages, without a sign of concern for you....F them. I'd drop communication with them, and not bother announcing the birth.\n\nBest of luck to you, baby and husband.", "NTA.

Geez get a grip.", "ESH.\n\nYou couldn't have known such a dramatic thing would happen, but you should probably have at least told your SIL. Even if you hadn't had the health scare, there was no way to be certain no one would notice or figure out that you were pregnant.\n\nI understand why you wanted to keep it to yourself, and wouldn't want to announce it after your SIL announced her pregnancy. Your family should be more understanding too. But I can also see why they would be upset - that doesn't excuse not checking to see if you were okay though.", "YTA. Come on. You should have told SIL that you were pregnant prior to the event and let her decide if you should come.\n\nEdit: To everyone that disagrees, I want to point out where OP writes that they didn't announce bc SIL announced her pregnancy first and they felt awkward about it. So then why go to her baby shower knowing that people might find out there, if the intention truly was SiL's best interest?", "NTA You had a legit reason to keep it private. You maybe could have told SIL privately before and said you were concerned about stealing some attention but over all, nta.", "You're at 8 months. It is exceedingly difficult to think that you would have gone through the entire event without it being revealed. You should have stayed home or told SIL. It's her shower. You don't announce your own pregnancy then, either stay home or give her a head's up. There was no way you were going to return home without your secret being known.", "NTA and everyone's shoddy behaviour after finding out like they did suggests you were right not to tell them.", "NTA\u2026 as someone who has lost a baby, I can completely understand on wanting to wait. And keeping it hush hush. You get to tell people when you are ready. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to gauge whether you should have been more persistent on staying home rather than go, considering with pregnancy things can change by the minute. \nFor future reference, maybe have a plan in place or a code word for situations as such when it feels like something could be happening with your pregnancy. Again, that is only should you choose to! \n\nEnjoy your last couple weeks!!", "NTA\n\nI also have had a complicated pregnancy at 18 that resulted in the loss of a child. You are totally within your right to keep it a secret until you're ready to share that info to avoid any complications, as stress can be a factor in baby's health.\n\nThey shouldn't be acting like you planned this. Pregnancy is literally the development of a life with a mind of its own.

Not judging, I don\u2019t know your family dynamic\u2026 but people get salty when those that are close to them have big life changes and they find out after the fact.

If someone noticed (before she started having pains) and tried to draw attention to it, I imagine OP would have quietly confirmed and then requested the attention be put back on the SIL. \n\nBut as someone with a previously traumatic history, when she started to have what she thought were labour pains, she understandably tried to leave as quietly as she could.

With that being said, she should've communicated or denied the invite for the party, but this can cause resentment from the family too. While going 8 months pregnant wasn't the best choice, she should've made an excuse or not went even if hiding the pregnancy for the reason I stated above. SIL wanted her pregnancy to be the top but shit happens, what would she do if she known and this still happened? From what I'm gathering SIL is more upset over the fact that an announcement was made someone else was pregnant at her event than anything else, even more than your health. That shows colors of them- be mad and upset that yes that happened, but what about your health? That's where a conversation should've took place, not berated with texts because people are upset.

Call her and apologize for the scene.  Explain that due to the still birth you weren't comfortable sharing the pregnancy until you had a healthy birth, but you wanted to support her regardless, and would not have said anything if you hadn't been suddenly concerned about a medical emergency.  \n\nWhat happened here wasn't good communication on your part, and it might take some time and some long conversations to repair the issue. Being secretive can protect you some, but it also causes problems because people jump to the wrong conclusions.", "YTA. On the surface it sounds like you did everything you could to not upstage your SIL's baby shower, but at the end of the day you showed up to a baby shower eight months into a secret pregnancy and everyone found out in the most dramatic way possible. You said you haven't announced it yet because it felt awkward to do so after SIL announced her pregnancy, which I understand but there's gotta be a limit there somewhere. This sounds like it was a way more awkward situation than just announcing your pregnancy a while after SIL did would have been. You don't have to tell anyone you're pregnant, can 100% just head to an event with a newborn to do the announcing for you if you want, but that doesn't seem to be what you wanted in this situation. \n\nEven announcing your pregnancy at a babyshower would garner less attention than people finding out you're almost full term, have been hiding it, and are now possibly in labor. You could very easily have spoken to SIL ahead of time, let her know you're pregnant but **you** don't really think you're showing (the fact that you say you got a few looks but nobody asked you outright makes me think you look more pregnant than you may think), would she like you to come and risk everyone finding out or should you sit this one out.", "I guess I\u2019m the only one saying NTA. You never have to announce a pregnancy if you don\u2019t want to. You went to the baby shower to support her and you thought you were going into labor which you couldn\u2019t help.

But I'm just curious how long you were planning on waiting to tell your family? Because, like, I get being secretive because you're nervous about prematurity and stuff, so if you were 5 months, 6 months or even 7 months, I could understand keeping it quiet...but 8 months?? That baby is fully formed. People go into labor at 34 weeks all the time and have perfectly normal babies. So barring any serious complications, that baby was coming. AND you knew you had a history of preterm delivery at 28 weeks... So what were you waiting for? Im just confused because if this had happened any earlier I would have totally been on your side, that this is a legit medical emergency and you did your best to not attract attention to yourself until you absolutely had to. But how far along you were, it just seems strange... Why had you not told anyone yet when you were only 2 weeks away from term? And why would you have gone when you knew you were high risk? You passed your previous delivery marker weeks ago (congrats again!) so it just all seems kinda weird that you would go and then be surprised when you started having symptoms.... \n\nI'm not sure how to vote. I wanna say ESH. They shouldn't have gotten mad at you for a legit medical situation, but you also set yourself up for a weird situation. I kinda feel like you shoulda known better in a sense... \n\nStill, congrats on everyone being healthy. That's most important.", "NTA.

Rather than celebrating the person the shower is for, everyone is going to be congratulating the person who just shared good news. What happened here is even more intense, not only are all the guests going to be shocked that OP is eight months pregnant, but they're going to be shocked they didn't know, each person is probably going to be wondering if they're the only one who didn't know, etc. It turns SIL's baby shower into speculation about OP's pregnancy, even more so since she didn't say anything.", "You think it\u2019s OK for her family members not to share her joy if she gives birth to a healthy baby but didn\u2019t tell them?

To them, all they see is OP and SO showing up to see family after a long time and lo and behold she is pregnant and no one knew, I really can\u2019t blame the host for that reaction. Also if you\u2019re 8 months pregnant and intended on keeping it a secret then don\u2019t go. Obviously she was showing based on the fact their original idea was to not go and they were getting looks prior to the incident. Also side effects are part of \u201cshowing\u201d you\u2019re pregnant as is evident by what happened. So TA part comes from thinking she\u2019d actually be able to hide it and decided to attend anyways and ended up spoiling everything.

It\u2019s the fact that OP hid her pregnancy for 8 months showed up at the baby shower had false labor so the baby shower was focused on her and not who the shower was for originally.  It would be like announcing your pregnancy at someone else\u2019s wedding or asking someone to marry you at someone else\u2019s wedding.

Instead, lack of communication makes it seem like they were trying to upstage SIL.\n\nSoft esh imo. OP could have given the SIL a warning and there wouldnt have been a cluster like this.

I get maybe not announcing early at the same time SIL announced but they could have done it at the next event. I had a lot of anxiety announcing my second pregnancy so I sent a group text to my family. It doesn't always have to be a big deal announcement. My sister announced her second pregnancy two months later and there was no big deal. Just excitement the cousins would be close in age", "Yeah that's why I think it's a ESH.

They will feel sooo betrayed and this will likely cause a rift between you and them. Sure, nobody is owed information, but you know very well that hiding such a major life changing event will make a mess. They will feel lied to, because every time you spoke to them, you lied by omission \"how are you?, what is happening?\".

You may have been tempting fate since pregnancy is obviously harder to hide the further along you are, but you\u2019ve been able to hide it so far. Once your pain started, you tried to discreetly leave and, unfortunately, your husband panicked when everyone was crowding you. \n\nYour post and comments make it clear your family all knew about your stillbirth. That is an incredibly traumatic experience. Anyone with an ounce of empathy would understand why you\u2019d want to keep this pregnancy under wraps. Ignore the texts, they\u2019re not worth engaging. Focus on you and your baby and I hope the rest of your pregnancy is smooth sailing.", "When, how and why did baby showers take on this stupid reverence? It\u2019s not a diplomatic meeting of state. It used to be just \u201cYay, I\u2019m having a baby, thanks for the prezzies, have some cake\u201d. Now there are these ridiculous rules of decorum about what can be announced, when it can be announced and mandatory full disclosure if they haven\u2019t already announced. This shit is getting as bad as toxic wedding culture. \n\nNever mind that OP had a late term stillborn child. If it were me, I would be a little hesitant to make any big pronouncements. Not that she OWES anybody besides her partner and on/gyn that information.", "You're NTA but this thread is chock full of them. There are a million reasons why a woman might want to keep a pregnancy secret, and yours is the most valid. \n\nTo all the people saying she had to have known that people would notice at 8 months, that's not true. My last job was in a grocery store; it was winter, and I had to work in the freezer a lot, so I always wore a slightly oversized hoodie. Everybody who worked in the store knew I was pregnant, but only the people in my department knew how far along I was. One woman expressed shock a few days before I left that I was leaving \"so early\" in my pregnancy. It was less than three weeks before my due date, but she thought I was in my first trimester. \n\nWhen I got pregnant with my third, I was devastated. I already had an 18 month old and a 4 month old, I had been trying not to get pregnant and obviously failed miserably, and I was embarrassed and overwhelmed. I only told my mom because I needed her to watch the other two during my OB appointments and begged her not to tell anybody until I was ready to act happy and excited about it. She completely ignored it and started telling people in our family one by one. I begged her to AT LEAST not tell my oldest brother and his wife, as they had suffered a still birth two years prior and a string of earlier miscarriages as well. I knew it would be a slap in the face to them that I was upset over having several healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies in rapid succession. She told him anyway because \"He's your brother!\" The expectation that everyone needs to know about every pregnancy ASAP is just asinine and has nothing to do with anyone's feelings. At a certain point it's just socially licit gossip.", "This really annoys me.  Just because it\u2019s you birthday, baby shower, wedding whatever,  why does the whole day have to be about you.  Why does all the attention have to be on you.  Yes be the star of the show but be aware that life still goes in around you. Possibly OP should have been upfront but that was her decision. Even if SIL is annoyed it\u2019s no reason not to even ask if OP is ok. She really needs to get over herself.  NTA", "NTA. They sound really petty. You owe these people nothing.

I think there is enough love and celebration for everyone and if pregnant person gets upset or offended thats on them! Their are millions of people that are also pregnant when they are! I truly don\u2019t get it!!", "I'm very firmly going to say NTA, because:\n-you claim you're small enough to pass the baby bump off as weight gain and I'm inclined to believe you since you hid the pregnancy for 8 whole months\n-no one was saying anything about it at the baby shower as far as we can tell\n-the only reason your plan failed is bc you had a medical emergency.\n\nIt is absolutely nonsensical for everyone in these comments to say that you shouldn't have gone and for these people to say that the reason why is bc you had a miscarriage when like once a week there's a post like \"aita for refusing to go to a baby shower bc I had a miscarriage\" with the comments being like \"yta get therapy and learn to cope bc other people have babies\"\n\nI truly don't get what is wanted from you here. A medical emergency does not the ah make", "NTA. Who cares if she kept it a secret. When you've had a prior traumatic pregnancy/birth keeping any future pregnancies a secret is completely understandable.

And for afterward that nobody cared about her/baby's wellbeing is just crap.", "NTA I wish I hid my pregnancy from family as they are abnoxious as hell. I didn\u2019t tell for quite some time as my cousing gave birth when i was 11 weeks and didn\u2019t want to steal her light. Figures, that was a problem and my mum and said cousin were upaet for quite a while I kept it from them. My in-laws didn\u2019t find out until i was 18w, as my hubby wanted to let them know for christmas, and lo and behold, SIL was upset we didn\u2019t tell sooner and my family knew before them. There is no winning in this and your SIL would find a reason to be upset either way. You had a medical emergency you couldn\u2019t predict. One would think the family would be happy about the news, especially after the stillbirth, but looks like one ego is more importat than your baby\u2019s and yours wellbeing.

But women are losing their minds these last few years over this type crap.", "NTA.\n\nAfter experiencing the indescribable loss of a stillbirth, keeping a later pregnancy private is, imo, totally understandable.

We just break happy news such as that when convenient or during happy events where usually more or lots of ppl you love gather together and it sometimes is planned beforehand with the host or might just be a surprise for everyone. In my view this is a happy news and people should just celebrate. So what if this is my birthday/wedding/party or whatever?! It's a good news that will make people even more happy! I don't understand why do people get so upset... At my wedding my cousin announced his engagement and I  felt it made my wedding even more special, not to mention our bond got even stronger because of that. I felt so proud and happy for them and somehow their wedding and marriage became very important for us, like it will be a good omen or will bring more luck. People didn't forget about me and shoved me in a  dark corner. To be honest I was a bit grateful for those few moments when people went to congratulate them as I was getting a bit tired and could sit down instead of constantly greeting/taking/dancing and mingling with the guests. But people tend to remember that my wedding was special because of that announcement and spoke about it for a long time. I read a lot of stories like that on reddit about people being so upset because other family/friends announce happy news while in their event but can't understand why they think this will make their event less than it is or that they steal the spotlight... but then again I have a different culture and a different perspective when it comes to celebrations.

I believe you could hide the bump as I could for most of my pregnancy but it reaches a point where it's still going to get attention. So I would guess that people knew but weren't wanting to ask out of respect. That's probably why they are considering it a 'stunt', because you had 8 months to tell them and it came out in a dramatic fashion at an event to celebrate someone else's pregnancy.\n\nI'm going with YTA. You should have left when you noticed the pains 'eventually' getting more aggressive, and I'm skeptical that you apparently weren't concerned given your 'extra cautious' behaviour until this point.

I'm usually all for ppl announcing-or not announcing-major life events whenever they're ready/confident/want, but it sounds like you *were* ready and had time but just didn't and made excuses for it. Why would it be awkward to announce your pregnancy after SIL? Give her maybe a few weeks (and that's being generous imo) to enjoy the attention and then make your own announcement. It's not like ppl wouldn't be able to realize you got pregnant before her when your baby was born, and it's not like she gets a monopoly on baby announcements for a long time. \n\nHow long ago did SIL announce her pregnancy? You're being very vague here by only saying a few months after your pregnancy. How long were you planning on waiting until announcing anything? It's the 11th hour.", "NTA. You didn't go there with the intention of announcing your pregnancy and in fact tried to hide it. It would still be NTA even if you had shown up in a bodycon dress showing your baby bump.

It\u2019s none of anyone\u2019s business. You hid it well and you even tried to hide it when you went into false labour at the SIL\u2019s shower. The only reason anyone found out was because you had a really sharp pain and couldn\u2019t hide a big cramp. You trying to leave the baby shower while having cramps and trying to hide it so you don\u2019t shine the light on your pregnancy shows you didn\u2019t want to take the spotlight from your SIL.\n\nYour SIL is upset and I get it, but her first question should have been whether you were okay.", "Are you alright?\nNTA", "If she hadn\u2019t had the cramps, nobody would\u2019ve even noticed apparently.

Your pregnancy is your business, you had a stillborn so you're in your right to wait until the baby is born to announce.

Definitely NTA.", "I put it this way... You made a mistake not simply saying something to both sets of parents and SIL before the shower. I won't say you were an ahole. You had valid reasons almost every step of the way, and your intentions were always good.\n\nFrankly, I think it's a shame that your SIL can't understand why you hadn't said anything and can't believe that you had no underhanded intentions. I hate when people are convinced that a person they normally love and know would have done something on purpose to cause harm. Sure, the way things worked out was a bit of a bummer for SIL. But that doesn't mean you ever intended to draw attention away from her. It's also nowhere near as important as the fact that you and the baby were in a concerning state and the good news now that you both are OK.\n\nIf there's an ahole in this story, I'd say it's the SIL for her priorities and her willingness to think the worst of you. Don't worry about that. Just take it easy and focus on you, your hubby, and your baby. Good wishes!", "I'm not American, are pregnant women not allowed on baby showers? Is it bad luck or something?

Maybe I\u2019d be a little salty because I\u2019d love all the attention for myself! Lol but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter to me more than my family growing. There\u2019s just too much good that comes from a pregnancy/birth. We can talk about planning a shower for her, our kids will get to grow up together, we can experience motherhood together etc. \n\nThat\u2019s what sisterhood/motherhood means to me. I\u2019m open about how much I love attention but I also don\u2019t like competing with other woman especially not family.

If it were just them wanting to keep the information private due to medical concerns, fine. But it seems like if SIL hasn't been pregnant, OP might have announced? I'm not sure what OP wanted to accomplish here, then. \n\nLike, if I was having a baby shower and my SIL who I knew had had issues with pregnancy started having contractions when I didn't even know she was pregnant, I would be utterly baffled. And feel horrible she felt obligated to come to my shower during such an emotionally vulnerable time. No shower is worth that. I'm not excusing the family being shitty, but I understand being pissed.

It\u2019s no one\u2019s business until OP and husband decide it is.  The stillbirth my sister had was 3 days from her due date, the umbilical cord tore and my niece died in the womb.  I don\u2019t blame OP for not wanting to go through that trauma again and waiting until they had a child to show for it (my daughter was almost born at 22 weeks and I remember looking at the chances for survival every week until she was born, the trauma sticks with you).  \n\nOP is not the asshole for knowing her body and how to hide the pregnancy, and wanting to support a family member who wanted her there.  Her family should not have stopped and crowded them when she was clearly in distress and trying to get to the hospital, and they definitely are assholes for causing her additional stress at this point.

She wasn't expecting it to happen.  It's understandable to an extent for SIL to be a little upset, but to be so self-absorbed that you rile people up enough to send a family member abusive messages???

OP is not a stranger.\n\nI think OP probably shouldn't have caved to the pressure and just not gone, which is where I lean ESH- especially as an event at 8 months is getting risky to begin with, and husband didn't exactly handle this well on his end. There's a way to bow out quickly and gracefully, but them again, he also has reason to panic.\n\n SIL, however, should have accepted the original \"no\" and all of this would have been avoided.

And just bc we\u2019ve made this weird baby shower culture around it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s medical and they have a right to privacy around things involving their body and their health. Period.", "What??!!!", "Yeah, a lot of people commenting that she's free to chose when to tell as if pregnancy isn't a pretty time-sensitive thing.", "I just came from that post", "Same. I hate the whole \u201cqueen for a day\u201d thing.  NTA", "Not to nitpick but it's actually probably closer to 11-12 weeks shorter. Pregnancy actually lasts 40 weeks, and 25 weeks is closer to almost 5 months. It is significantly further along than her previous one. A preemie born at that stage has a pretty great chance at survival.\n\nAt that point people would barely have time to adjust to the news of a new baby. Now, I understand totally why they did it, but I also understand why her family didn't respond well (to an extent, the nasty messages is too far)", "Based on SILs reaction I can understand why she wouldn't wanna tell her privately either, tbh.", "Oh, yes, pulling a pulmonary stunt like that is very rude and selfish...", "Same just read the comments there and came here. I\u2019m done with Reddit for the day :(", "I read a well phrased post like this and I can't help but be upset at the bodily and emotional trauma that women go through and are just *expected* to, if not forced, to go through.", "Felt this very deeply. Thank you.", "I also recently learned that the US has births earlier on average than other developed countries, along with a higher maternal/infant death rate. I knew the latter, but the former surprised me. Then again, we are, as a culture, always rushing.", "8 months is not 32 weeks. A month isn\u2019t four weeks (except for this one now). 8 months is 34.66667 weeks, so essentially 35 weeks. At 37 weeks you\u2019re full term (up to 42). A pregnancy is c. 9 months from ovulation. I am currently 8 months pregnant myself and cannot wrap my head around the possibility of springing a real life baby on my unknowing family.", "Then you get people that just want you to shut up about it because it makes them uncomfy. You know what was uncomfy? Knowing my baby died inside me and I couldn't protect. Yeesh people are stupid. \n\nNot you just other people.", "Pretty sure I\u2019ve seen a post about a bride who didn\u2019t want to invite her partner\u2019s grandparent in case they died or something.", "SIL said she wanted her there, presumably because she cares about her. When you care about someone, it is understandable that you\u2019d be upset if they hid something this big from you. I understand being cautious in the beginning, but as OP herself mentioned they were going to announce and clearly were comfortable doing it despite their past and only didn\u2019t because of SIL\u2019s announcement (perhaps you forgot that?)\n\nFamily are TA for the messages (and worse, how do you not check on OP?), but I also don\u2019t think OP handled it the best she could have.", "Not even just physical health. She has major psychological trauma and that doesn't matter to anyone, because she's pregnant and people think wombs are public property and the \"person\" attached to them is just a birthing vessel. Nothing is your own when you're pregnant.", ">That excuse could be that you came down sick,\n\nHow hard would it have been for OP to say, \"I'm sorry. I was exposed to someone who just tested positive for COVID. I don't want to risk spreading it to you.\"\n\nOr, \"I'm sorry. I ate some bad sushi last night and I'm pretty sure I have food poisoning.\"\n\nShe could've thought of something.", "People knew.  They just didn't say anything to be polite. During my cousin's wedding, her SIL was pregnant but didn't tell anyone about it. It was no surprise to anyone when they announced the baby's arrival 3 months later. We all could tell she was pregnant, we just didn't say anything.", "I'd say rocking a (previously unannounced) baby bump at someone else's baby shower is EXACTLY like flashing an engagement ring at someone else's wedding.", "It may be counter to the majority, but I share your opinion too. \nThis couple has suffered a traumatic pregnancy experience prior to this. I completely understand that they wanted to keep it themselves. But keeping it to themselves doesn't mean OP has to retreat from society \ud83d\ude11 \nI'm surprised to see all these people claiming OP was an AH here...", "She's also likely afraid to tell people or be happy about the pregnancy until she has a healthy baby in her arms. Being pregnant after having a loss like that must bring back a lot of scary feelings, and OP may have been scared to tell anyone or let herself hope until she knew this pregnancy would result in a healthy living baby.", "The only person at my wedding I would have been upset with for getting attention was my brother-in-law. He was an alcoholic & drug addict. Fortunately, my husband's best friend was there to keep BIL in line & wouldn't let him have anything to drink before the wedding & monitored how much he drank at the reception. My cousin brought her 4 month old & I danced with him. I must admit that was the first time I ever danced with a towel on my shoulder in case my partner decided to throw up."]}
