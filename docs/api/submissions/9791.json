I decided to try my best to hide the bump and go.\n\nIt was all going well, no one noticed, I mean I got a few looks but no one asked me anything. Then about an hour in I started having tiny cramps, that eventually got more aggressive. I told my husband we need to leave I need to go to the hospital. As We we\u2019re walking a sharp pain hit me and I grabbed the picnic table next to me and almost stumbled over causing attention to myself. I really thought I was in labor, the pains were getting so intense. People started surrounding us, asking what was the matter and my husband says \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, guys she pregnant, something\u2019s goin on, we have to leave.\u201d He was panicked himself. He rushed me to the hospital.\n\n\nBy the time we got the hospital my pains had subsided, they said it was false labor.

Your caution is understandable. Maybe your husband could have not dropped that bombshell that way, but he was rightfully concerned.\n\nYour SIL is a jerk for not even asking if you and the baby were OK. She wasn't in the wrong for feeling upset about her baby shower being derailed a bit, but she should have been more understanding, since you lost your other baby, since you were in pain.", "NTA. People aren't entitled to know about your pregnancy.", "Firstly, congratulations on your pregnancy and I am glad you and baby are both healthy.  That being said, in this instance YTA.  You are 8 months along, can go into labor any day, and it comes out at your SIL's baby shower?  That is extremely disrespectful.   I get why you kept it private in the beginning.  You should have told them before the shower and offered to not come if it would be an issue.", "ESH\n\nYou could have mentioned it privately to your SIL beforehand. I understand the fear after losing a child, but by the time you're in your 3rd trimester, your close family should probably know. Especially if you plan to attend someone else's baby shower.", "Oh NTA this is so shit of everyone. Nobody's damn business if you're pregnant or not and you didn't plan to have a scare at the baby shower!", "NTA. Baby stunt??? Said to someone who's suffered a stillbirth? Keep them all away til baby is here and you feel well enough to deal with them.", "ESH. Now of course, I am obviously unaware of your familial situation nor do I see it relevant to this story but your communication could've been so much better. You can't go to an event like this in the state you're in without the host and a few others knowing your situation. If you were in labour, it could've been so much worse. Not to mention that you probably stole all the attention off of SIL considering you left in such a dramatic way. I just don't think this was one of your brightest moments. However, I do think that SIL should've been a tad bit more understanding despite your, in my opinion, unwarranted secrecy. She probably felt hurt that you hadn't told her. I definitely think people are cutting you slack because you're pregnant. In conclusion, ESH but you're the major asshole.-", "NTA\nYou had reasons to keep it quiet.\nAnd even if you didn't have a specific reason, it's still your business to share, or not share. \nSiL wanted you to go, even though you didn't want to go.\n\nThis isn't the same as showing up to steal her thunder, with a purposeful pregnancy announcement. \n\n\nAs for the people who sent angry messages, without a sign of concern for you....F them. I'd drop communication with them, and not bother announcing the birth.\n\nBest of luck to you, baby and husband.", "NTA.

Geez get a grip.", "ESH.\n\nYou couldn't have known such a dramatic thing would happen, but you should probably have at least told your SIL. Even if you hadn't had the health scare, there was no way to be certain no one would notice or figure out that you were pregnant.\n\nI understand why you wanted to keep it to yourself, and wouldn't want to announce it after your SIL announced her pregnancy. Your family should be more understanding too. But I can also see why they would be upset - that doesn't excuse not checking to see if you were okay though.", "YTA. Come on. You should have told SIL that you were pregnant prior to the event and let her decide if you should come.\n\nEdit: To everyone that disagrees, I want to point out where OP writes that they didn't announce bc SIL announced her pregnancy first and they felt awkward about it. So then why go to her baby shower knowing that people might find out there, if the intention truly was SiL's best interest?", "NTA You had a legit reason to keep it private. You maybe could have told SIL privately before and said you were concerned about stealing some attention but over all, nta.", "You're at 8 months. It is exceedingly difficult to think that you would have gone through the entire event without it being revealed. You should have stayed home or told SIL. It's her shower. You don't announce your own pregnancy then, either stay home or give her a head's up. There was no way you were going to return home without your secret being known.", "NTA and everyone's shoddy behaviour after finding out like they did suggests you were right not to tell them.", "NTA\u2026 as someone who has lost a baby, I can completely understand on wanting to wait. And keeping it hush hush. You get to tell people when you are ready. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to gauge whether you should have been more persistent on staying home rather than go, considering with pregnancy things can change by the minute. \nFor future reference, maybe have a plan in place or a code word for situations as such when it feels like something could be happening with your pregnancy. Again, that is only should you choose to! \n\nEnjoy your last couple weeks!!", "NTA\n\nI also have had a complicated pregnancy at 18 that resulted in the loss of a child. You are totally within your right to keep it a secret until you're ready to share that info to avoid any complications, as stress can be a factor in baby's health.\n\nThey shouldn't be acting like you planned this. Pregnancy is literally the development of a life with a mind of its own.

Not judging, I don\u2019t know your family dynamic\u2026 but people get salty when those that are close to them have big life changes and they find out after the fact.

If someone noticed (before she started having pains) and tried to draw attention to it, I imagine OP would have quietly confirmed and then requested the attention be put back on the SIL. \n\nBut as someone with a previously traumatic history, when she started to have what she thought were labour pains, she understandably tried to leave as quietly as she could.

With that being said, she should've communicated or denied the invite for the party, but this can cause resentment from the family too. While going 8 months pregnant wasn't the best choice, she should've made an excuse or not went even if hiding the pregnancy for the reason I stated above. SIL wanted her pregnancy to be the top but shit happens, what would she do if she known and this still happened? From what I'm gathering SIL is more upset over the fact that an announcement was made someone else was pregnant at her event than anything else, even more than your health. That shows colors of them- be mad and upset that yes that happened, but what about your health? That's where a conversation should've took place, not berated with texts because people are upset.

Call her and apologize for the scene.  Explain that due to the still birth you weren't comfortable sharing the pregnancy until you had a healthy birth, but you wanted to support her regardless, and would not have said anything if you hadn't been suddenly concerned about a medical emergency.  \n\nWhat happened here wasn't good communication on your part, and it might take some time and some long conversations to repair the issue. Being secretive can protect you some, but it also causes problems because people jump to the wrong conclusions.", "YTA. On the surface it sounds like you did everything you could to not upstage your SIL's baby shower, but at the end of the day you showed up to a baby shower eight months into a secret pregnancy and everyone found out in the most dramatic way possible. You said you haven't announced it yet because it felt awkward to do so after SIL announced her pregnancy, which I understand but there's gotta be a limit there somewhere. This sounds like it was a way more awkward situation than just announcing your pregnancy a while after SIL did would have been. You don't have to tell anyone you're pregnant, can 100% just head to an event with a newborn to do the announcing for you if you want, but that doesn't seem to be what you wanted in this situation. \n\nEven announcing your pregnancy at a babyshower would garner less attention than people finding out you're almost full term, have been hiding it, and are now possibly in labor. You could very easily have spoken to SIL ahead of time, let her know you're pregnant but **you** don't really think you're showing (the fact that you say you got a few looks but nobody asked you outright makes me think you look more pregnant than you may think), would she like you to come and risk everyone finding out or should you sit this one out.", "I guess I\u2019m the only one saying NTA. You never have to announce a pregnancy if you don\u2019t want to. You went to the baby shower to support her and you thought you were going into labor which you couldn\u2019t help.

But I'm just curious how long you were planning on waiting to tell your family? Because, like, I get being secretive because you're nervous about prematurity and stuff, so if you were 5 months, 6 months or even 7 months, I could understand keeping it quiet...but 8 months?? That baby is fully formed. People go into labor at 34 weeks all the time and have perfectly normal babies. So barring any serious complications, that baby was coming. AND you knew you had a history of preterm delivery at 28 weeks... So what were you waiting for? Im just confused because if this had happened any earlier I would have totally been on your side, that this is a legit medical emergency and you did your best to not attract attention to yourself until you absolutely had to. But how far along you were, it just seems strange... Why had you not told anyone yet when you were only 2 weeks away from term? And why would you have gone when you knew you were high risk? You passed your previous delivery marker weeks ago (congrats again!) so it just all seems kinda weird that you would go and then be surprised when you started having symptoms.... \n\nI'm not sure how to vote. I wanna say ESH. They shouldn't have gotten mad at you for a legit medical situation, but you also set yourself up for a weird situation. I kinda feel like you shoulda known better in a sense... \n\nStill, congrats on everyone being healthy. That's most important.", "NTA.

What happened here is even more intense, not only are all the guests going to be shocked that OP is eight months pregnant, but they're going to be shocked they didn't know, each person is probably going to be wondering if they're the only one who didn't know, etc. It turns SIL's baby shower into speculation about OP's pregnancy, even more so since she didn't say anything.", "You think it\u2019s OK for her family members not to share her joy if she gives birth to a healthy baby but didn\u2019t tell them? It\u2019s OK for family members to be surprised/offended they didn\u2019t know. But they should understand her reasons for not sharing. People need to get over their egos when there are life and death situations.", "And best wishes to you, OP! I am sorry for your loss. Sending positive vibes.", "No one comes to terms with that kind of loss. My mom had a late miscarriage years before I was born, and nearly 40 years later, she still cries over her lost baby.", "Honey, her last pregnancy ended at 25 weeks. I can see why she wouldn\u2019t want to share until the actual birth happened.", "Well just imagine your SIL that you really like comes to your babyshower 8 month pregnant,  almost giving birth and running away in panic..this is inadequate", "[reminds me of jesus](https://i.imgur.com/ujSKlcM.jpg)", "You\u2019ve never been hurt by a sibling, have you?", "It was a potential medical emergency, Would sil be mad about a heart attack?", "As she should be. The party is about that person. That's allowed and okay.", "After all, you didn't announce the pregnancy your spouse did.", "It\u2019s crazy. Baby showers and weddings, people go absolutely fucking loco on this subreddit.", "Finally someone with some sense OP is not the asshole here. She said she could hide her baby bump and I\u2019ll take her word for it. It\u2019s not like she showed up to the party in a skin tight dress.", "I mean yeah I agree but if you\u2019re going to someone\u2019s baby shower, that\u2019s an event that\u2019s about them and their pregnancy.", "Then don\u2018t attend the party. Yikes.", "No sister-in-law isn't owed knowledge about the condition but in addition and 8 months pregnant person is not given carte blanche to just go to somebody else's pregnancy party and upstage them.", "Facts", "Then don\u2019t fucking go. She said her SIL really wanted her there. Say you\u2019re sick and send a gift if you don\u2019t want to tell her.", "Right, then don't go to a baby shower for someone else's baby.", "The problem isn\u2019t not telling. The problem is blind siding the family at a baby shower. What\u2019s the difference between telling the SIL before the event, and showing up eight months pregnant? YTA and there\u2019s a real logic gap here", "But like. Those are things that you can't predict. She was eight months pregnant. Labor pain and false contractions happen.", "The issue isn\u2019t the false labor. Its the fact they didn\u2019t tell anyone they were pregnant and they presumably don\u2019t immediately know their intentions for keeping it a secret. It may seem obvious to us because OP is directly telling us why but I wouldn\u2019t hold it against anyone else for not immediately putting the pieces together. To them, all they see is OP and SO showing up to see family after a long time and lo and behold she is pregnant and no one knew, I really can\u2019t blame the host for that reaction. Also if you\u2019re 8 months pregnant and intended on keeping it a secret then don\u2019t go. Obviously she was showing based on the fact their original idea was to not go and they were getting looks prior to the incident. Also side effects are part of \u201cshowing\u201d you\u2019re pregnant as is evident by what happened. So TA part comes from thinking she\u2019d actually be able to hide it and decided to attend anyways and ended up spoiling everything. Regardless of her intentions she still ended up stealing the spotlight from the pregnant host and this could have easily been alleviated by giving a different excuse for not going or coming clean, at least to the host, prior to showing up.", "No, she should not have gone to a birthday party either if she wanted to keep her pregnancy hidden. She has every right to not want to share with others but she also didn\u2019t do much to stop speculation by attending the event. She could have easily faked being ill.", "She didn\u2019t intend to announce? SHES 8 MONTHS. THERE IS NO ANNOUNCEMENT. if you don\u2019t want people to know until the baby is born then you don\u2019t go to stuff.", "Absolutely not. She could have informed her SIL when she got invited and discussed this over to make SIL and party goers not shocked and much more comfortable. Instead OP decided to keep quiet and \u201choped\u201d people will not notice a possibly quite obvious pregnant belly.", "But she knew she could have an early birth since it had already happened. \n\nShe should've just sent her husband alone. \n\nGoing there knowing there's a chance of people noticing your condition just showed how much she didn't care about possibly ruining the party for the others.", "Normally it's not. But OP had hid her whole pregnancy for 8 months, showing up to someone else's baby shower with a surprise 8 month long baby bump is going to make the baby shower about that surprise pregnancy.", "It\u2019s not disrespectful to attend a baby shower while pregnant.  It\u2019s the fact that OP hid her pregnancy for 8 months showed up at the baby shower had false labor so the baby shower was focused on her and not who the shower was for originally.  It would be like announcing your pregnancy at someone else\u2019s wedding or asking someone to marry you at someone else\u2019s wedding.  Bottom line you shouldn\u2019t make big announcements whether overtly or discreetly at someone else\u2019s life event.", "Nah, it is about being empathetic. Op knew it might cause an issue (she didn't want to go) and instead of just calling SIL and explaining the situation, she continued to keep her pregnancy under wraps. If everyone (or at least the SIL) knew beforehand, nobody would see it as op hiding then making a big scene for no reason. Instead, lack of communication makes it seem like they were trying to upstage SIL.\n\nSoft esh imo. OP could have given the SIL a warning and there wouldnt have been a cluster like this. The party goers don't know the background so it seems like OP was trying to make a scene, but, even if she was, they should make sure she's OK instead of attacking her.", "No one is going to assume you\u2019re trying to upstage them if everyone already knows prior. Thats the point, you\u2019re not \u201csurprising\u201d anyone therefore you can\u2019t be upstaging. The family hasn\u2019t seen OP in a long time presumably and she shows up pregnant. You don\u2019t see how the host would have an issue with that? Are they supposed to read OPs mind as to why she didn\u2019t tell anyone and just shows up pregnant?\n\nAnd your last sentence is just irrelevant. It was important to the SIL and thats all that matters. You don\u2019t have the right to shit on it just because you disagree. That is definitely asshole behavior.", "Yeah it's a little crazy. I get maybe not announcing early at the same time SIL announced but they could have done it at the next event. I had a lot of anxiety announcing my second pregnancy so I sent a group text to my family. It doesn't always have to be a big deal announcement. My sister announced her second pregnancy two months later and there was no big deal. Just excitement the cousins would be close in age", "Yeah that's why I think it's a ESH. The family are being dicks. I get they are probably hurt and confused but still show some empathy", "They're being blamed for the lack of consideration", "Having a tragedy doesn't absolve you from having manners in later situations. It was fine if they wanted to wait to tell people, but waiting so long that it was \"awkward\" was on them, not declining or warning the host ahead of time was a bad choice they made as well. They had options, they just didn't want to be \"awkward\".", "Then don\u2019t go. Make up another excuse or explain why to the SIL. Otherwise live with the consequences of your actions. If you decide to try and be slick and not tell anyone anything and it comes out anyways then don\u2019t be surprised when the host gets mad. Can\u2019t expect her to read OPs mind, she doesn\u2019t know her intentions for keeping it a secret and then showing up 8 months pregnant.", "Agreed. I\u2019m not really getting all the y-t-a\u2019s on this one. *She had a stillborn pregnancy at 17.* That\u2019s traumatic for anyone, but especially a teenager. It\u2019s really no wonder they didn\u2019t tell anyone this time. \n\nI knew a girl in HS who hid her pregnancy with baggy clothes. Her parents didn\u2019t even know until she was in the hospital giving birth. Obviously that method worked for OP, too, since no one at the shower noticed even when she was being rushed out by her boyfriend. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP went to the shower with malicious intent. NTA.", "I get that babies are exciting and pregnancies are (often) meant to be events to celebrate. But people seem to forget that this is a major medical event for the mother. Her body goes through enormous changes. There are risks. Nobody in the family was entitled to know about the pregnancy until she and her husband were ready. Her family's reaction only validates her decision to keep it from them.", "You are going out of your way to defend this person's blunder. I wonder why.", "Sure, she also didn\u2019t have to go in the first place. Her fuck up was thinking she could actually hide this at 8 months pregnant. Can\u2019t blame the host for not knowing why OP decided to show up pregnant to her baby shower and having THAT be the moment everyone finds out. Like, their first intention was to not go, clearly part of them knew it was a bad idea and they decided to do it anyways.", "Yeah she also didn\u2019t have to completely upstage her SIL\u2019a event but she didn\u2019t anyways", "Actually that was part of her reason not to talk about her pregnancy, because with the first the family knew from the beggining and they were happy... So when she gave birth and the baby was... They were all devastaded. Let me see where she wrote it...\n\nEdit to add OP's comment \"That was kind of the plan, we wanted our privacy and was worried about the What Ifs. Last time around everyone planned and prepared for our baby, so many people were crushed with the passing.\"", "Exactly! Why are people shaming a person for not wanting to go through that again and doing what they can to avoid it. Makes me so sad that people can\u2019t seem to empathize.", "Mine too. I honestly had my mom tell most of my immediate family and my husband told his friends while I dealt with my friends. I was still running into people weeks later asking me how the baby was or congratulating me, only to burst into tears and have to explain. It was so awful. I tried to hide my second pregnancy for a while because we were so scared, and I was honestly terrified up until I gave birth and now I\u2019ve got a whole new fear - SIDS. It\u2019s a ride, and no one \u201cdeserves\u201d to know anything", "r/lostredditors \n\nWelcome to AITA! Hope you have a wonderful first day!\n\nI meant it is a way of telling them I understand specifically the complexities of family so without more information I couldn\u2019t say whether that was a good decision or not. I am still judging them on everything else, hence the the point of the sub.", "If keeping it a secret was that important and their intention wasn\u2019t to steal the spotlight then simply don\u2019t go. Make up another excuse for not going, otherwise you should suck it up and come clean before attending so the host doesn\u2019t misinterpret the situation like what happened. Clearly they knew it would be a bad decision by the fact their first thought was to not go. Their baby, their decision to announce but having it announced at a baby shower is the AH part. And whether she intended to announce or not is irrelevant when you decide to show up 8 months pregnant and expect no one to notice, she took a risk and lost.", "You are 100% NTA. You are completely entitled to do what you want with your pregnancy - no one has a \u201cright\u201d to know. I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone to the baby shower if you wanted to keep hiding it, but that\u2019s your decision and doesn\u2019t change the fact that your family is the AH in this situation", "My sister struggled with miscarriages and for a while gave up trying. Her and her husband decided not to let anyone know when they tried again. Sadly lost more we found out later. Then they got lucky and now have a gorgeous baby. I found out by getting a picture as did everyone except the grandparents (both sides). The awesome grandparents I may add who ran interference on why my sister had seemingly disappeared for a while. My initial reaction was shock obviously but never thinking it was done for any other reason than protecting themselves from more hurt. I\u2019m very happy for them and don\u2019t blame their reticence to say anything at all.", "It\u2019s hard to claim you wanted privacy while showing up 8 months pregnant to someone else\u2019s baby shower.", "Just a heads up, people hate being blindsided with a baby. Your baby your rules, but you risk damaging lots of relashionships with that.", "I get because of you history this is what you want, but I hope you and your partner seek therapy for support to work through the trauma of this horrible lost. BUT honestly, think about the impact of hiding it waaay past the risky period on your relationship with your family and friends who don't know. They will feel sooo betrayed and this will likely cause a rift between you and them. Sure, nobody is owed information, but you know very well that hiding such a major life changing event will make a mess. They will feel lied to, because every time you spoke to them, you lied by omission \"how are you?, what is happening?\". You physically hid from them and that send the message \"I did not trust you, I do not feel that close to you, I put a LOT of effort into keeping you out of what is happening in my life\". You need to have an open talk with your family and express your process to mend the breach. I wish you a safe delivery!", "Husband is also TA\n\nI think you AND your husband could have handled it better if you really and truly wanted to keep this secret/not upstage your SIL. You could have just not gone and say you had food poisoning or, if that wouldn\u2019t work, you could have told SIL the reason (I am pregnant and I do not want to take attention away from you IN ANY WAY) or your husband could have not blurted it out to everyone I stead of just saying \u201cshe is in pain and we don\u2019t know why, we are gonna go to the ER\u201d which still would have caused a scene, but not quite as dramatic of one (I am giving you the benefit of the doubt that you really were absolutely unable to prevent yourself from letting everyone know you were in pain-saying this as someone who went through labor and childbirth). You already were so careful about keeping it a secret, it just seems a little too coincidental that you suddenly thought you went into labor at your SIL\u2019s baby shower and your husband just HAD to tell everyone because you dramatically clutched the side of a picnic table. I\u2019m not saying you did all this on purpose, but I can understand why everyone thinks you did.", "Understood!Thank you!", "She decided they didn\u2019t need to know he existed. Even when it was quite obvious. She can live on the island SHE created. It\u2019s not about ego wtf. As I said she\u2019s free to conduct her life the way she wants.

If OP had told SIL, she still would\u2019ve had an emergency at her baby shower.

She did this on purpose to show up her sister-in-law and is acting like she didn't and that's b******* it's fairly obvious.", "SiL pushed it by guilting her.

Relive it again and tell one person with the expectation they announce it for you and then deal with the damage that game of telephone.\n\nor option 3. Leave your business to yourself and come home with a happy, healthy newborn and celebrate.\n\nAlso she went into false labor.

I\u2019m still attending gatherings, not often, but I\u2019m wearing looser clothes and no one has really said anything to me except my close friend who asked me how much weight I\u2019ve gained since my dad died (he passed in august, I knew I was pregnant in July.

There's a difference.", "I was walking by one of my neighbor's houses and realized that they had a baby when I saw a new car seat in their garage.  It definitely happens.", "That\u2019s your neighbor, not your family. Kind of a different scenario.", "Baby showers are basically to bring gifts to the expecting parents,but usually it's centered around the pregnant mother. Fun games etc. And it's just normal etiquette not to announce your pregnancy or show up with you secret 8 moth baby bump to other persons baby shower.

She was ALREADY getting looks so people suspected and then she had false labor and ran out. So it doesn\u2019t matter what she intended because it\u2019s exactly what happened.  Her sils baby shower became all about OP.

She probably would have been bitched out by the relatives for hiding it for so long no matter when they found out anyway, but getting outed at the baby shower just compounded it.  She probably needed to say \"oh, btw, I'm 8 months pregnant\" before the shower at the very least.", "The fact that people found out is proof that by going people might find out.", "Lmfao what medical emergency she had some Braxton hicks contractions. OP had numerous chances to make different choices yet funny enough every choice she made showcased her pregnancy at her sils shower. She\u2019s the asshole.", "I mean agree to disagree but you're just wilfully misinterpreting here", "This, fully. I am baffled by the y t a responses.\n\nThe poor woman had to give birth to a stillborn baby. It just blows my mind that anyone thinks she's obliged to tell anyone", "What you keep saying is 'my pregnancy is something that makes me feel ashamed'. Maybe so but you have a new person that is about to enter the world. Having people around you support and show love means that little one has all the more lift to do well in life. The mentality that what other people think matters is wrong. As you age I hope you will lose that and lean into the community of people who mean well for your little one. It doesn't matter what others think. There will always be critics and disappointment. Do your best and that also means try not to create bad blood especially with those who will not leave your life- aka family. How would you feel if your child did the same to you? It would hurt no matter how much you tell yourself they have the right to keep things from you. There's enough pain in the world. Try to do better. You are about to be a mom. You have to be at your best.", "Ok lol. What do you want me to say. She acted like the baby didn\u2019t exist.

Nobody would have noticed until she was rushed to the hospital.", "I definitely think OP should have said she felt sick and stayed home, but the person I was responding to was saying that SIL was justified in being mad that OP upstaged her when the reason that OP upstaged her was because she had a medical emergency", "Well, OP is now in a position to do so, by going LC with that family.", "And SiL was never entitled to know. SiL could have just accepted her absence.", "Shock valve??? Her having it revealed by early contractions was for shock value???", "Honestly, I wish she chose to stay home on this one. SiL may have hurt feelings about her absence, but I think it would have been less than what actually occurred.", "No one knew, until she was hit with contractions.", " I understand the fear after losing a child, but by the time you're in your 3rd trimester, your close family should probably know.", "The fact is she was also getting looks meaning that people clearly knew but thankfully they had the decency of not wanting to ask.

I'm just someone whose sister had a tragic stillbirth.  I know a large part of her trauma came from having to tell people about the loss, over, and over, and over. \n\nNews of a pregnancy travels fast. News of a stillborn, not so much. \n\nWhen she got pregnant the next time, my sister refused to buy anything for the baby - not a shoe, not a onesie, not diapers, nothing - until it was born.

A lot of people who have experienced miscarriages don't announce their pregnancy until they are past the point where they lost the baby.   Losing a baby is hard, especially when you have to go back and tell everyone about it.

I don't know of any health situations guys have, that are expected to be shared. Anything that happens with my body doesn't seem to call for sharing. But when a woman gets, she's expected to share in one form or another. And in many places, she loses a sense of autonomy.", "This has to be a cultural difference thing. They were there to be happy for SL for having a baby and sharing that with the world. OP chose to not share hers. Is it a \"my day\" thing?", "Who\u2019s saying they\u2019re ashamed? OP doesn\u2019t want to have to go from family member to family member disclosing another miscarriage again. People are not entitled to know you\u2019re pregnant.

You don't show up somewhere 8 months pregnant without expecting someone to comment about your baby belly if you haven't told anyone you are pregnant.  It's a beautiful baby belly, and worthy of its own time to shine.  I have no issues with her not telling family, I have no issues if they wanted to wait until 8 months or 9 months or until the baby was born, that's their choice.  I think they had better options that showing up at a baby shower for her SIL to announce her pregnancy.", "It seems the best solution would have been to talk to SIL about it.

I have no issue with them wanting to keep the pregnancy secret as long as they choose, but at 8 months pregnant, there's just too high a risk that someone will notice something or something will happen to make it apparent. And at someone else's baby shower is just not an appropriate place for your pregnancy to be announced, even by accident. Some people, especially the expectant mother whose shower you're at, are likely to be very hurt by it, no matter your intentions.", "And completely understandable when they were angry about them not telling them they were expecting", "I personally think the biggest reason the Sil is upset is because it seems like she was trying to steal her shine and instead of everyone celebrating the baby shower there talking about her stunt", "You don't think when she got looks people didn't know?", "You should not have to alert the host that you also are pregnant.", "The fact that her pregnancy was revealed is proof that if she went to the shower people might find out, because PEOPLE FOUND OUT.

OP could still stay home or at least reveal the pregnancy before the shower to SIL.", "Probably because neighbors don\u2019t look all that closely at you. My neighbors and I speak fairly regularly and I couldn\u2019t tell you what eye color they have or if they lost/gained any weight recently because it\u2019s just not on my radar.

Or or or she could have politely slipped out as opposed to making a scene and \u201ctripping\u201d on her way out from cramps. Or she could have sent her husband with a present and politely said she wasn\u2019t feeling well. Or she could have just sent their regrets and a present.  Or she could have told her sil when she received the invitation.  Or she could have announced her pregnancy ANYTIME in the 8 months BEFORE her sister in laws shower. I could keep going because there were so many different choices she could have made yet suspiciously every choice she made was for maximum attention at her sils baby shower and then wants to be all shocked and shaken and clutch her pearls that people think she wanted to have all the attention while simultaneously crying about how she didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen. Fuck outta here", "Yes it does because as I said, repeatedly, there were so many different choices she could have made to stop this from happening yet at every turn she chose to go this option.  No way people would not figure out that she was 8 months pregnant and surprise surprise they did. She knew what was going to happen she still chose to go anyway.  She could have politely excused herself when she started getting looks. She didn\u2019t. She could have politely excused herself when she started having cramps she didn\u2019t. Every choice she made was for maximum attention and she got what she wanted. Of course sils upset.", "I'd rather not, this is exhausting", "Possibly it is! Certainly in the western world, it is considered very odd not to tell your family you are heavily pregnant. People would typically be very confused/curious (and possibly alarmed, I\u2019d be hurt and worried if my SIL and brother kept a pregnancy secret from the entire family for so long) when they noticed her very pregnant stomach. It was always going to distract from SIL\u2019s day.", "Honestly, given the reaction from the relatives, it's a good reason to go NC with them.", "Ideally, I think she would have been better off staying home. But I reject the idea she owes anyone else knowledge about her condition. \n\nPeople on this thread seem to see baby showers like bridal showers.\n\nBoth events are important.\nBut they differ in that one involves the condition of a specific person. She suddenly owes notice to others that she is pregnant. \n\nAn engagement is simpler. Don't wear the ring. And don't mention it at someone else's event. \n\nIt seems one way or another, OP is in a position of being less than, because of her pregnancy.", "Honestly, it really doesn't matter. This isn't like announcing an engagement at a wedding or another engagement party. This all tied to an unreasonable demand on pregnant women to disclose their own condition. \n\nThis may sound shocking, but a person's medical condition is their own business. Pregnancy IS a medical condition. She is no less a person, due to that specific medical condition.", "Agreed. Keeping it a secret is totally fine, but that's not what she did here. She kept it a secret verbally, but put herself in a situation where it was highly likely people would find out *during a baby shower for someone else*", "That's what struck me too. People staring but not outright asking 'hey are you very pregnant' to me means people noticed but weren't rude enough to ask.", "When I was pregnant I never looked pregnant. Neither did my mother. Both of us wore our regular clothes the entire time.", "Are women's emotions so fragile that 100% of all the attention at a baby shower must be on them, jesus grow up, btw OP never intended on anyone finding out so she wasn't actively seeking attention.", "If people make assumptions, that's on them.", "Exactly.  My sister carried really small but there are still signs that anyone who has been through pregnancy and childbirth can see.  Women have been doing this for years and even if it's a few dark circles and excuse of not sleeping with baggy clothes on we aren't stupid.and probably thought she wasnt that far along yet, but definitely pregnant.i don't think it was malicious  intent but it was niave and not well thought out.", "Sure, but then don\u2019t complain when the host gets upset for taking attention away from her moment. If you don\u2019t want to disclose that personal information then fine, just don\u2019t go.

Or send a really nice gift with hubby but stay home herself saying she had stomach Flu or whatever", "If you don\u2019t want people knowing you\u2019re pregnant then, at 8 months along, maybe don\u2019t go to events where people are present. Just a thought\u2026", "Thank you! There are too many people in this thread that feel that friends and family are entitled to your current medical state. Its quite disgusting.", "She only didn't want anyone else to know because she couldn't bring herself to tell them at an earlier time because SIL was pregnant. That's a weird anxiety issue she needs to work through. I understand why she has it based on her past. But she has to realize if she's going to commit to not saying anything then send a gift and skip the shower", "Didn't OP basically say, she didn't want to go to the party - she relented because SIL insisted, basically she felt like she had to or risk seriously hurting SIL's feelings?", "She wasn't so obviously pregnant that people congratulated her or asked about the baby - or tried to touch her belly, which people do when they think you might be pregnant, even when you're not.\n\nShe got some weird looks, but people aren't subtle when they think there might be a baby in the future.\n\nShe had to have hid it well, or cousin would have pitched a big fit a lot sooner, don't you think? And if that's what she felt comfortable with, that's fine - nobody is owed her medical situation. \n\nOP took attention with a medical issue -- but tried to get out without making a fuss, even about that.

Her husband was the one who blew it, not her.\n\nAlso, did you somehow miss the fact that she previously lost a pregnancy that was just *seven weeks* younger than her current one? She has every right to not want to get anyone\u2019s hopes up.\n\nOn top of *that,* for all we know, SIL could\u2019ve also thrown a fit if OP revealed the pregnancy when it was first confirmed. That happens all the same time, and SIL definitely sounds like the sort who would accuse OP of deliberately trying to \u201csteal attention\u201d by getting pregnant around the same time.\n\nThe baby shower is supposed to be preparing for the *baby.* It\u2019s not supposed to be ego-boost for the mother, which is how you and SIL seem to be treating it.", "Taking OP at their word they started getting cramps, excused themselves, got a crazy cramp that made her grab a table and draw attention to herself, then the husband revealed they were pregnant.

Then there's unexpected things that happen.

I maybe could've pulled off not pregnant from behind since I was all bump.\n\nI got asked when I was due from 6 months and if I was expecting twins since 8th. Definitely couldn't have pulled it off.", "But this isnt what happened, it's like being mad at someone for having a heart attack at your party.", "Ok.
