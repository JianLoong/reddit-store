So this pregnancy we\u2019ve been extra cautious, and secretive. I haven\u2019t seen family much these past few months and I carry small, but as I developed a bump I\u2019ve been wearing hoodies and loose clothing. With that I kind of just looked like I gained weight. \n\nWe were hesitant on me going, I was just going to send my husband with a gift of mine, but SIL said she really wanted me there. I decided to try my best to hide the bump and go.\n\nIt was all going well, no one noticed, I mean I got a few looks but no one asked me anything. Then about an hour in I started having tiny cramps, that eventually got more aggressive. I told my husband we need to leave I need to go to the hospital. As We we\u2019re walking a sharp pain hit me and I grabbed the picnic table next to me and almost stumbled over causing attention to myself. I really thought I was in labor, the pains were getting so intense. People started surrounding us, asking what was the matter and my husband says \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, guys she pregnant, something\u2019s goin on, we have to leave.\u201d He was panicked himself. He rushed me to the hospital.\n\n\nBy the time we got the hospital my pains had subsided, they said it was false labor. My husband and I both had angry texted messages from SIL and other guest at the party about us hiding the pregnancy,how messed up it was, and how they couldn\u2019t believe I showed up pregnant and was secret about it.

People aren't entitled to know about your pregnancy.", "Firstly, congratulations on your pregnancy and I am glad you and baby are both healthy.  That being said, in this instance YTA.  You are 8 months along, can go into labor any day, and it comes out at your SIL's baby shower?  That is extremely disrespectful.   I get why you kept it private in the beginning.  You should have told them before the shower and offered to not come if it would be an issue.", "ESH\n\nYou could have mentioned it privately to your SIL beforehand.

Now of course, I am obviously unaware of your familial situation nor do I see it relevant to this story but your communication could've been so much better. You can't go to an event like this in the state you're in without the host and a few others knowing your situation. If you were in labour, it could've been so much worse. Not to mention that you probably stole all the attention off of SIL considering you left in such a dramatic way. I just don't think this was one of your brightest moments. However, I do think that SIL should've been a tad bit more understanding despite your, in my opinion, unwarranted secrecy. She probably felt hurt that you hadn't told her. I definitely think people are cutting you slack because you're pregnant. In conclusion, ESH but you're the major asshole.-", "NTA\nYou had reasons to keep it quiet.\nAnd even if you didn't have a specific reason, it's still your business to share, or not share. \nSiL wanted you to go, even though you didn't want to go.\n\nThis isn't the same as showing up to steal her thunder, with a purposeful pregnancy announcement. \n\n\nAs for the people who sent angry messages, without a sign of concern for you....F them. I'd drop communication with them, and not bother announcing the birth.\n\nBest of luck to you, baby and husband.", "NTA.

Geez get a grip.", "ESH.\n\nYou couldn't have known such a dramatic thing would happen, but you should probably have at least told your SIL. Even if you hadn't had the health scare, there was no way to be certain no one would notice or figure out that you were pregnant.\n\nI understand why you wanted to keep it to yourself, and wouldn't want to announce it after your SIL announced her pregnancy.

You maybe could have told SIL privately before and said you were concerned about stealing some attention but over all, nta.", "You're at 8 months. It is exceedingly difficult to think that you would have gone through the entire event without it being revealed. You should have stayed home or told SIL. It's her shower. You don't announce your own pregnancy then, either stay home or give her a head's up. There was no way you were going to return home without your secret being known.", "NTA and everyone's shoddy behaviour after finding out like they did suggests you were right not to tell them.", "NTA\u2026 as someone who has lost a baby, I can completely understand on wanting to wait. And keeping it hush hush. You get to tell people when you are ready. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to gauge whether you should have been more persistent on staying home rather than go, considering with pregnancy things can change by the minute. \nFor future reference, maybe have a plan in place or a code word for situations as such when it feels like something could be happening with your pregnancy.

You are totally within your right to keep it a secret until you're ready to share that info to avoid any complications, as stress can be a factor in baby's health.\n\nThey shouldn't be acting like you planned this.
