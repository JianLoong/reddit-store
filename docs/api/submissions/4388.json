I helped her put away some shopping when I got there.\n\nThere were some small bottles of pepsi that I forgot to put in the fridge so they were just sitting on the counter.\n\nA couple hours later, Tom gets home from work and he sees the pepsi bottles on the counter and he starts flipping out. He goes on about how he can't drink room temperature pepsi and that they should be in the fridge.\n\nI told him it was me and that I just forgot to put them in the fridge and apologised. Apparently that wasn't good enough and Tom went off about how stupid it was to not put them in the fridge and that I have no common sense. I sarcastically told him that this is a disaster and how ever will he recover from this. Tom called me a \"useless bitch\".\n\nI decided to just leave, and later I texted my mum and Tom and told them that unless he genuinely apologises for calling me a bitch and being so rude to me over PEPSI BOTTLES, Tom's not invited to Christmas anymore.\n\nMy mum sends me paragraph after paragraph making excuses for Tom, and saying that I'm being unfair. \n\nShe said I'm making her choose between me and Tom and that I'm unfairly putting her in a difficult position, and accused me of punishing her for a situation she didn't cause.\n\nI told her I don't care and that no apology means no invite for Tom, and that I don't want him attending if he can't apologise for his actions.\n\nShe said I'm being petty and acting like a child with birthday party invites, and said I'm being a Scrooge.

Tom is TA, and sound like a ridiculous human being. He should have disrespected you in that way over a beverage. And he should apologize and you should definitely demand an apology.  \n\n\nAttaching the Christmas party to this was unnecessary, and without knowing you or Tom personally, I just assume that you did it to leverage Tom into apologizing. He doesn't seem to be the apologizing type from your description.\n\nHere is how I would have done it. Go home calm down so not to say something unnecessary in the spur of the moment. Call Tom or see him in person when everything has calmed down. Apologies again for doing what you did, without any snarky comments, tell him that you was hurt by his comments and that they where undeserved and crude. If he then apologize I would consider it water under the bridge. He might have had a bad day and overreacted, seen his mistake and apologized.\n\nIF he doesn't apologize and doesn't see why he should. Then ask you mother (not while Tom is present) if she thinks it is fair that he called you what he called you. If she deflects or agrees with Tom. I would ask her, if she came home to you, and forgot to put Pepsi into the fridge and you husband called her a \"useless bitch\" would she want a apology? If she still doesn't see eye to eye, I would distance myself from them. That is a toxic behaviour and your mother has the Stockholm syndrome.
