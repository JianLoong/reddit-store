He goes on about how he can't drink room temperature pepsi and that they should be in the fridge.\n\nI told him it was me and that I just forgot to put them in the fridge and apologised. Apparently that wasn't good enough and Tom went off about how stupid it was to not put them in the fridge and that I have no common sense. I sarcastically told him that this is a disaster and how ever will he recover from this. Tom called me a \"useless bitch\".\n\nI decided to just leave, and later I texted my mum and Tom and told them that unless he genuinely apologises for calling me a bitch and being so rude to me over PEPSI BOTTLES, Tom's not invited to Christmas anymore.\n\nMy mum sends me paragraph after paragraph making excuses for Tom, and saying that I'm being unfair. \n\nShe said I'm making her choose between me and Tom and that I'm unfairly putting her in a difficult position, and accused me of punishing her for a situation she didn't cause.\n\nI told her I don't care and that no apology means no invite for Tom, and that I don't want him attending if he can't apologise for his actions.\n\nShe said I'm being petty and acting like a child with birthday party invites, and said I'm being a Scrooge.

Tom requires pepsi to be cold in his home, you don't allow people who won't apologize for calling you a useless bitch over unrefrigerated non-perishables in your home.

Tom is TA, and sound like a ridiculous human being. He should have disrespected you in that way over a beverage. And he should apologize and you should definitely demand an apology.  \n\n\nAttaching the Christmas party to this was unnecessary, and without knowing you or Tom personally, I just assume that you did it to leverage Tom into apologizing. He doesn't seem to be the apologizing type from your description.\n\nHere is how I would have done it. Go home calm down so not to say something unnecessary in the spur of the moment. Call Tom or see him in person when everything has calmed down. Apologies again for doing what you did, without any snarky comments, tell him that you was hurt by his comments and that they where undeserved and crude. If he then apologize I would consider it water under the bridge. He might have had a bad day and overreacted, seen his mistake and apologized.\n\nIF he doesn't apologize and doesn't see why he should. Then ask you mother (not while Tom is present) if she thinks it is fair that he called you what he called you. If she deflects or agrees with Tom. I would ask her, if she came home to you, and forgot to put Pepsi into the fridge and you husband called her a \"useless bitch\" would she want a apology? If she still doesn't see eye to eye, I would distance myself from them. That is a toxic behaviour and your mother has the Stockholm syndrome.

Ok, she'll have to live with the consequences.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is married to a man who more than likely speaks to her the exact way he spoke to you. Your mother is in an abusive relationship. Of course she's going to work to steady the boat, she has to live on it.\n\nHold your ground and let your mother know his behavior is childish, abusive and unacceptable.

Feel like we are missing...something.", "NTA - uninvite your mom too, her bad choice in partners is not your responsibility to deal with.", "NTA no 60 year old man should be throwing a temper tantrum over Soda... that he could've had with ice \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

You don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way and certainly don\u2019t have to socialize with someone who treats you that way.   Clearly your mother is used to his abuse and making excuses for him.", "He called you *what*?? \n\nAbsolutely NTA. The man is horrible. \n\nIs your mum okay, though?", "I feel bad for your mom.  Yes, she got herself into this situation, but he probably belittles her constantly.  That type of verbal abuse can really wear a person down.  So maybe treat her kindly.

So I'm sure he's shown you plenty of rude behaviour before and you've kept him on the guest list for your mother's sake. You want to blow this argument up to estrangement level, I guess that's your call.\n\nThe time for you to demand an apology was in the moment. You should have told him immediately that you weren't going to tolerate him personally attacking you like that.  An insincere apology then was probably pointless anyway but it's definitely that way now.", "Yep, you are going too far. This is a clearcut case of ESH. Tom is the first and best AH for being so mean and hurtful even after receiving an apology. Holding Christmas hostage makes you the AH. Everyone will suffer because you want to exclude Tom, even though he is the first and biggest AH. Mom is being an AH by calling you names. Now you CANT back down without legitimizing Tom and Mom's bad behavior. Mom cant back down without legitimizing your demands and throwing her husband under the bus. Tom wont back down because he's an AH. If the three of you cant figure out how to de-escalate, you need to find someone else to host Christmas.

Mom is in an abusive relationship and defending her abuser. Not only that, she's heaping abuse on her own child to try to force OP to accept it like she does.\n\nThis is a very sad situation.
