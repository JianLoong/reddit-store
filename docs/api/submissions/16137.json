You're right. His ailments are awfully convenient. And that one upping is annoying.  Have a serious conversation about your concerns. He is dumping all of the house and childcare on you. That's not Right", "NTA\n\nThis is how men get out of doing shit.  Along with spending 500 hours in the bathroom.  The fact that he is suddenly unwell every time you are - bullshit.", "NTA. This would annoy me to think I\u2019d be long out of sympathy. Difficult to know how to handle it though outright accusing him of making it up he\u2019ll just deny it, turn it back to you and make you out to be a bad person, there\u2019s not really anyway of disproving someone doesn\u2019t have a headache when they say they do.", "NTA chronic pain simply doesn't go away since your kids are asleep. Granted id be excited to game also. But if its simply excitement then he is fine but if all \"ailments\" are simply gone then yeah fuck him", "NTA but if he is having all these problems then he should see a Dr. My husband and I are in our late 20s and both have health issues as well as experience pain almost daily. I have a ankle that never fully healed because I tore two tendons which don't grow back and my other ankle decided it wanted to start causing problems during the same time so now both my ankles and feet hurt nearly all the time. My husband has a partial knee replacement and experiences pain with it as well as his back. We both deal with migraines. Among other issues but we see a Dr about it. If he isn't willing to see a Dr about his many ailments then there isn't nothing wrong with him besides wanting to one up you and making excuses not to be a team player. If that's the case then personally, I couldn't live with that. But definitely not the AH for being tired of putting up with it either way. If something is truly wrong then that's when you should see a Dr not complain on a daily without trying to fix the problem.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think you said the thing that really bothers you. He doesn\u2019t participate in the household when he feels unwell. And you never get to be sick, because he\u2019s sick too. The constant complaining (and implied request for sympathy) are wearing you down.\n\nProceed as though there is something wrong with him. CFS, fibromyalgia, etc. You live with someone with a disability. \n\nAsk these questions: \nWhat is he doing to manage his pain and diagnosed illness? Is he fully engaged in management/treatment? Did he make a concerted effort to get a diagnosis and treatment for his pain? \n\nWhat is he consistently capable of contributing to the household? Does he do that?\n\nDoes he express awareness that the household labor is divided unevenly due to his constant illnesses? \n\nWhat factors make him feel better/worse?\n\nWhat happens if he \u201cpowers through\u201d when he feels unwell? \n\nWhen is he willing to put himself out for you? \n\nI think answering those questions is important. Then talking to him about them, and what changes you need/want. Whether it\u2019s just less bitching or more help.", "NTA- i would feel the same way you do. it\u2019s not realistic for someone to always have something wrong with them. he is definitely trying to pull the wool over your eyes", "Nta though he likely doesn't actually know he's doing it, that doesn't justify that he is. I think most people are familiar with feeling awful until we're off the hook. But making the entire relationship revolve around it isn't cool", "Info: does he ever take an active role in parenting? Does he ever take initiative in parenting?", "NTA regardless of his ailments he is your partner and a father to 3 children he has the responsibility of caring for you all in that manner, if he is not even able to muster sympathy when you are unwell why is he around? Time to have a serious sit down with yourself and think about what you need and want in a partner and then ask him to step up and go from there.", "NTA. You should communicate more clearly together and ask him questions about what you see. Maybe you can both identify what is affecting him and find a way to help out the whole situation.", "NTA. But maybe you guys are just getting old. I'm in my 30s and already rickety as fuck and yeah, ngl..when I get home from work and can just sit down and game or watch TV...my back starts hurting a little less.", "INFO there are a few things that could change the dynamic. Why are you fed up mostly? I assume it is due to him always having something wrong so you have to watch the kids/do chores/cook etc. Or does he help out still? Has he seen a doctor? Or has he been complaining about these chronic issues while refusing to see one? Do you feel like you get breaks? Or do you feel like everything is on you to do? Ask him how he's feeling before mentioning you have a headache. If it goes something like, \n\n\"I'm fine why?\" - him\n\n\"Because I've got a massive headache.\" - You\n\n\"Yeah I've had one too now that you mention it.\" - him\n\n\nThen that's a bad sign. I don't want to say he's faking to get out of work but either he is and it needs to stop or he isn't and you need to find a solution that doesn't leave you burnt out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There was one just a few months back where the OP wasn\u2019t ever \u201callowed\u201d to be the sicker one and was always in charge of the children even when sick \u2014 the husband would start feeling like the sickest person into he world the moment the OP mentioned feeling sick. So suspicious that it all seems to go away when the kids are asleep and it\u2019s gaming time.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a little too convenient that after the kids go to bed he\u2019s all better. I used to do this sort of thing when I was about 5 years old. I\u2019d have to do something I didn\u2019t want to do and I\u2019d complain of a stomach ache, or my ear hurts, something silly and my mom would say if I\u2019m not well enough to do whatever chore, then I\u2019m not we\u2019ll enough to play games. I\u2019d recommend helping him with his sicknesses. Send him to bed or the doctor. If he\u2019s not well enough to help put the kids to bed, he\u2019s not well enough to game. Him one upping you everytime you\u2019re sick is highly annoying and that may just require a direct conversation about how often that happens"]}
