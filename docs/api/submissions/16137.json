This would annoy me to think I\u2019d be long out of sympathy. Difficult to know how to handle it though outright accusing him of making it up he\u2019ll just deny it, turn it back to you and make you out to be a bad person, there\u2019s not really anyway of disproving someone doesn\u2019t have a headache when they say they do.", "NTA chronic pain simply doesn't go away since your kids are asleep. Granted id be excited to game also. But if its simply excitement then he is fine but if all \"ailments\" are simply gone then yeah fuck him", "NTA but if he is having all these problems then he should see a Dr. My husband and I are in our late 20s and both have health issues as well as experience pain almost daily. I have a ankle that never fully healed because I tore two tendons which don't grow back and my other ankle decided it wanted to start causing problems during the same time so now both my ankles and feet hurt nearly all the time. My husband has a partial knee replacement and experiences pain with it as well as his back. We both deal with migraines. Among other issues but we see a Dr about it. If he isn't willing to see a Dr about his many ailments then there isn't nothing wrong with him besides wanting to one up you and making excuses not to be a team player. If that's the case then personally, I couldn't live with that. But definitely not the AH for being tired of putting up with it either way. If something is truly wrong then that's when you should see a Dr not complain on a daily without trying to fix the problem.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think you said the thing that really bothers you. He doesn\u2019t participate in the household when he feels unwell. And you never get to be sick, because he\u2019s sick too. The constant complaining (and implied request for sympathy) are wearing you down.\n\nProceed as though there is something wrong with him. CFS, fibromyalgia, etc. You live with someone with a disability. \n\nAsk these questions: \nWhat is he doing to manage his pain and diagnosed illness? Is he fully engaged in management/treatment? Did he make a concerted effort to get a diagnosis and treatment for his pain? \n\nWhat is he consistently capable of contributing to the household? Does he do that?\n\nDoes he express awareness that the household labor is divided unevenly due to his constant illnesses? \n\nWhat factors make him feel better/worse?\n\nWhat happens if he \u201cpowers through\u201d when he feels unwell? \n\nWhen is he willing to put himself out for you? \n\nI think answering those questions is important. Then talking to him about them, and what changes you need/want.

I think most people are familiar with feeling awful until we're off the hook. But making the entire relationship revolve around it isn't cool", "Info: does he ever take an active role in parenting? Does he ever take initiative in parenting?", "NTA regardless of his ailments he is your partner and a father to 3 children he has the responsibility of caring for you all in that manner, if he is not even able to muster sympathy when you are unwell why is he around? Time to have a serious sit down with yourself and think about what you need and want in a partner and then ask him to step up and go from there.", "NTA. You should communicate more clearly together and ask him questions about what you see. Maybe you can both identify what is affecting him and find a way to help out the whole situation.", "NTA.

I'm in my 30s and already rickety as fuck and yeah, ngl..when I get home from work and can just sit down and game or watch TV...my back starts hurting a little less.", "INFO there are a few things that could change the dynamic. Why are you fed up mostly? I assume it is due to him always having something wrong so you have to watch the kids/do chores/cook etc. Or does he help out still? Has he seen a doctor? Or has he been complaining about these chronic issues while refusing to see one? Do you feel like you get breaks? Or do you feel like everything is on you to do? Ask him how he's feeling before mentioning you have a headache. If it goes something like, \n\n\"I'm fine why?\" - him\n\n\"Because I've got a massive headache.\" - You\n\n\"Yeah I've had one too now that you mention it.\" - him\n\n\nThen that's a bad sign.

That's not fair to you. You're important to the dynamics as well. \n\nI think your partner could benefit from therapy. He has had a life-threatening event twice.

He's had 2 spontaneous pneumothorax happen (no underlying issue, it was explained to us that he is prone to them happening because of his size - tall and natually slim/underweight) \nHe has been hospitalised twice for two separate occasions of his lungs puncturing and has had an operation on one lung and is awaiting the referral for the other side (NHS so it's bit of a wait).\n\nHe does do chores (admittedly probably not enough as he could). \n\nI think I've just gotten to a point where I'm tired of feeling like I feel bad if I'm unwell, if that makes sense? I feel so embarrassed for even writing this post in the first place but hearing him complain about his leg earlier today just irked me more than usual.

It's not dismissive of the issues that BF has while still acknowledging that living with someone who has chronic illness is incredibly difficult. \n\nDepression is incredibly common in people with chronic conditions, for obvious reasons. That can contribute to lack of motivation or energy to do things. Or feeling like you're not good enough, so why bother? The other thing I would think that could cause problems for BF is that he has established lung issues. *Something* causes him to have the pneumothorax episodes, even if it is not clear to medical professionals what that is. Without knowing all the details of his health and treatment it is impossible to say, but it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable to think that his overall lung health and function could be compromised.. and that's going to affect nearly every system in his body.\n\nOf course he still needs to be contributing to the household and parenting responsibilities in a way that is appropriate to his capacity, and OP at the moment doesn't feel like he is. It's something that needs discussion but it's important to not be accusing or shaming. It is possible that he is \"milking\" the condition to get out of responsibilities but there is also a chance that his actions are explainable by completely normal chronic illness type things that may not occur to either of you. For example, feeling better and feeling up to gaming after the kids are in bed : a) gaming is a fairly low impact activity and b) the kids being in bed means the pressure and guilt of needing to contribute is eased somewhat, and that makes it much easier to relax. \n\nChronic illness is such a terrible thing to live with in part because it isn't just you that is affected, it's the people you love as well. Learning to manage a chronic illness to maximise your capacity to function is something that requires lots of frank, honest communication from all parties and commitment to listen without judging and reacting defensively. OP, you need to figure out truly how much your BFs health issues do affect him doing things and then decide how you want to proceed from there. I know you are frustrated right now and feeling like he unfairly isn't pulling his weight - I just wanted to add on to the sentiment of the comment that I am replying to, that from the POV of someone with a chronic illness, what you describe doesn't necessarily sound abnormal and a different approach might be what you need to resolve your problem.", "Nope.

I hope BF is not a smoker. If he hasn't already maybe he could ask about the procedure to prevent the lung from collapsing in the future. The aches and pains could be explained by anxiety and depression. Some antidepressants help manage pain, I am prescribed one myself. He could also ask the Dr what activities or interventions could help relieve pain like physical therapy, braces, icing and heating,swimming, stationary bikes, topical pain relive etc. I am picking up orthotics at the end of the week because my feet hurt, which makes my calves hurt, which makes my knee hurt,etc. Make an appointment with the PCP.
