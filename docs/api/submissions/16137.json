You're right. His ailments are awfully convenient. And that one upping is annoying.  Have a serious conversation about your concerns. He is dumping all of the house and childcare on you. That's not Right", "NTA\n\nThis is how men get out of doing shit.  Along with spending 500 hours in the bathroom.  The fact that he is suddenly unwell every time you are - bullshit.", "NTA. This would annoy me to think I\u2019d be long out of sympathy. Difficult to know how to handle it though outright accusing him of making it up he\u2019ll just deny it, turn it back to you and make you out to be a bad person, there\u2019s not really anyway of disproving someone doesn\u2019t have a headache when they say they do.", "NTA chronic pain simply doesn't go away since your kids are asleep. Granted id be excited to game also. But if its simply excitement then he is fine but if all \"ailments\" are simply gone then yeah fuck him", "NTA but if he is having all these problems then he should see a Dr. My husband and I are in our late 20s and both have health issues as well as experience pain almost daily. I have a ankle that never fully healed because I tore two tendons which don't grow back and my other ankle decided it wanted to start causing problems during the same time so now both my ankles and feet hurt nearly all the time. My husband has a partial knee replacement and experiences pain with it as well as his back. We both deal with migraines. Among other issues but we see a Dr about it. If he isn't willing to see a Dr about his many ailments then there isn't nothing wrong with him besides wanting to one up you and making excuses not to be a team player. If that's the case then personally, I couldn't live with that. But definitely not the AH for being tired of putting up with it either way. If something is truly wrong then that's when you should see a Dr not complain on a daily without trying to fix the problem.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think you said the thing that really bothers you. He doesn\u2019t participate in the household when he feels unwell. And you never get to be sick, because he\u2019s sick too. The constant complaining (and implied request for sympathy) are wearing you down.\n\nProceed as though there is something wrong with him. CFS, fibromyalgia, etc. You live with someone with a disability. \n\nAsk these questions: \nWhat is he doing to manage his pain and diagnosed illness? Is he fully engaged in management/treatment? Did he make a concerted effort to get a diagnosis and treatment for his pain? \n\nWhat is he consistently capable of contributing to the household? Does he do that?\n\nDoes he express awareness that the household labor is divided unevenly due to his constant illnesses? \n\nWhat factors make him feel better/worse?\n\nWhat happens if he \u201cpowers through\u201d when he feels unwell? \n\nWhen is he willing to put himself out for you? \n\nI think answering those questions is important. Then talking to him about them, and what changes you need/want. Whether it\u2019s just less bitching or more help.", "NTA- i would feel the same way you do. it\u2019s not realistic for someone to always have something wrong with them. he is definitely trying to pull the wool over your eyes", "Nta though he likely doesn't actually know he's doing it, that doesn't justify that he is. I think most people are familiar with feeling awful until we're off the hook. But making the entire relationship revolve around it isn't cool", "Info: does he ever take an active role in parenting? Does he ever take initiative in parenting?", "NTA regardless of his ailments he is your partner and a father to 3 children he has the responsibility of caring for you all in that manner, if he is not even able to muster sympathy when you are unwell why is he around? Time to have a serious sit down with yourself and think about what you need and want in a partner and then ask him to step up and go from there.", "NTA. You should communicate more clearly together and ask him questions about what you see. Maybe you can both identify what is affecting him and find a way to help out the whole situation.", "NTA. But maybe you guys are just getting old. I'm in my 30s and already rickety as fuck and yeah, ngl..when I get home from work and can just sit down and game or watch TV...my back starts hurting a little less.", "INFO there are a few things that could change the dynamic. Why are you fed up mostly? I assume it is due to him always having something wrong so you have to watch the kids/do chores/cook etc. Or does he help out still? Has he seen a doctor? Or has he been complaining about these chronic issues while refusing to see one? Do you feel like you get breaks? Or do you feel like everything is on you to do? Ask him how he's feeling before mentioning you have a headache. If it goes something like, \n\n\"I'm fine why?\" - him\n\n\"Because I've got a massive headache.\" - You\n\n\"Yeah I've had one too now that you mention it.\" - him\n\n\nThen that's a bad sign. I don't want to say he's faking to get out of work but either he is and it needs to stop or he isn't and you need to find a solution that doesn't leave you burnt out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So suspicious that it all seems to go away when the kids are asleep and it\u2019s gaming time.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a little too convenient that after the kids go to bed he\u2019s all better. I used to do this sort of thing when I was about 5 years old. I\u2019d have to do something I didn\u2019t want to do and I\u2019d complain of a stomach ache, or my ear hurts, something silly and my mom would say if I\u2019m not well enough to do whatever chore, then I\u2019m not we\u2019ll enough to play games. I\u2019d recommend helping him with his sicknesses. Send him to bed or the doctor. If he\u2019s not well enough to help put the kids to bed, he\u2019s not well enough to game. Him one upping you everytime you\u2019re sick is highly annoying and that may just require a direct conversation about how often that happens", "I know everyone jumps to divorce here, but sometimes I see a post that seems to be asking if OP has a right to their own feelings.

There\u2019s no permission you need from anyone if you are unhappy. There doesn\u2019t have to be a \u2018good enough reason\u2019 because if it\u2019s not working for you, then it\u2019s not working. We\u2019re just so invested in pushing our needs down and making ourselves small that we forget we have a right to be happy.\n\n\nIf it\u2019s not working, decide if you want to do the work.

It's called FUCKING LAZY. It's curable with an ultimatum.  He either steps up or steps out.\n\nAnd what do you mean by spontaneous pneumothorax? I've had two and it requires hospitalization, chest tube and/or surgery.  It's a collapsed lung. \n\nIt doesn't come with joint pain, body aches, headaches, only chest pain. My last one, I had a chest tube for a month and I was still able to do small chores, walk my daughter to school, and go by bus every other day to the hospital for x-rays. \n\nThere's missing info as to his medical condition but he doesn't have a pneumothorax.", "NTA\n\nI was about to say something very different until I read the thing about the 2 youngest going to bed. Your next point is also a huge red flag. Call him out and/or kick him out. That\u2019s manipulative bullshit right there.

Fibromyalgia & chronic fatigue are horrible to live with; it could also be depression. Men are nightmares for seeing medics but I think your man needs to do so; any kind of imbalance could be causing the things you\u2019ve described. It could be easily fixed. He could also just be a pain in the arse & you could be 100% right lol. \n\nBut, you may just be seeing it as him suddenly being okay when the kids are in bed because that\u2019s how it seems to you, it may not be how it actually is. Or if it is, he could feel very anxious around the kids so when they\u2019re asleep he does feel better because he just finds existing a bit less stressful. You\u2019ve got two kids under three & dads can experience parental depression like mums can, it just manifests differently & isn\u2019t well-recognised.\n\nETA: Chronic illnesses are also so fucking exhausting, including in ways that don\u2019t seem particularly obvious if you\u2019re not the one living with them. They take such a toll on your body & mind, & can really eat away at you. \n\nI\u2019m not excusing any half-arsed parenting or any neglect he may be inflicting on your relationship, just offering a different perspective I guess.

Assuming that someone is making it up when a doctor can\u2019t pinpoint what the issue is can be so harmful to the person suffering.

If they want to be sick, they better act the part or actually be sick. \n\nIt also works cause your kids will see how they will be treated when they\u2019re sick, and they will know that tv and games will be limited to non existent while they rest to get better.", "I would make him go to the doctor every time he feels ill.\n\nIf he\u2019s only in his 20\u2019s and always feels this ill then if he\u2019s genuine then there must be something seriously wrong with him.\n\nIf not, then I\u2019m sure he will soon get fed up of sitting in the doctors waiting room.", "NTA.

I am also tall and slender and had my first lung collapse at 17. I had another one 20 years later that required surgery.  He can't sit there in the corner doing the bare minimum.  That's not fair to you. You're important to the dynamics as well. \n\nI think your partner could benefit from therapy. He has had a life-threatening event twice.  Like accident victims and victims of abuse, it was a traumatic experience and it screws with the chemicals in your body.

It sounds like the issues only started up after the first was born, but why go on to have 2 more when you\u2019re already having all these issues?", "Apologies, I really didn't explain that part well. He's had 2 spontaneous pneumothorax happen (no underlying issue, it was explained to us that he is prone to them happening because of his size - tall and natually slim/underweight) \nHe has been hospitalised twice for two separate occasions of his lungs puncturing and has had an operation on one lung and is awaiting the referral for the other side (NHS so it's bit of a wait).\n\nHe does do chores (admittedly probably not enough as he could). \n\nI think I've just gotten to a point where I'm tired of feeling like I feel bad if I'm unwell, if that makes sense? I feel so embarrassed for even writing this post in the first place but hearing him complain about his leg earlier today just irked me more than usual. I know the pain in his lungs is 100% genuine which is why I've mentioned it over the years but probably not pressed on it as much as I could or should have.\n\nReading over all the comments and re-reading my post, I've come to realise that I'm possibly going through a burn out with everything. Although there are certainly some things that need to be addressed between he and I, he's not a bad person. We otherwise have a great relationship and he is a good father (only complains to me about the pain, never shows or acts on it with the kids). We've talked to some doctors before but nothing ever came of it so I think I'll press that some more.\n\nSorry for jumping on your comment alone, I wrote this post on an emotional whim and realised how poorly I'd explained the lung issues so thought I'd go a bit more indepth with the whole thing.
