She went into her room while she was gone and lo and behold under her bed was a box and in it was a bunch of our missing jewelry. It was crazy. We took back our things and even considered calling the police, but didn't know how to prove it. We ended up reporting it to the dean, but since we lived on off campus student housing, we were forced to live with her for the rest of the lease.

That\u2019s, like, a class 3 felony and includes jail time. You kind of did her a favor by never reporting her to official channels (not that you still can).

How does your interfering sister know this? If there's no reason to assume that the thief is still a thief, then there's no reason to assume that the thief is no longer a thief. Why assume anything?\n\nIt isn't just the thefts. It's her arrogant DEFENSE of robbing you and your friends that is so disturbing. \"You're rich, so I can.\" \n\nNTA.", "I'm a bit on the fence here. On the one hand, ten years is a long time and people do sometimes change. I am assuming that the school would do background checks on anyone they hired so one would think that if she had continued her stealing ways this would have come out. OTOH, most people dont change, and if you are an AH at 19 your are probably still going to be one at 29. \n\nIn any case, I think that the school has the right to know about past bad behavior that may not have come out during a routine background check. People lie about their past and she may have too.

Of course the dean wont do anything, you lived outside of college jurisdiction.\n\n2) A decade later, you do enough to get her fired. I know she stole, and I know you were upset with that.

Did you consider that something was off in her live back then maybe? 3. Did you consider that there are people with a mental health problem? Stealing as coping something else? I highly believe it in your case as she did steal things that was values to you and hide it under her bed. 4. Did you consider that she didn't really double down but defending herself without telling you the real problem she had? 5.

This woman has an absolutely no remorse for stealing and actually doubled down and said we deserved it\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have said anything if she had shown even the slightest remorse, but she didn\u2019t.

We found the box in her room of our stuff but that\u2019s not really much proof. And even if we were 20 when everything happened, I don\u2019t see how that justifies her stealing thousands of dollars worth of things from her roommates that\u2019s not OK at any age. She was never remorseful and said sorry, and we saw her on campus for the next following years. Her next roommate also accused her of stealing. \n\nShe isn\u2019t his teacher.

I don\u2019t see why he should change rooms when he really likes his teacher and friends he\u2019s made the first week. And many students come wearing expensive clothes and jewelry that we don\u2019t want stolen.

She also said we had no proof and that there is nothing that we can do about it and we don\u2019t deserve the things anyways, she was not remorseful at all.

And as I said: stealing is not ok. But I wanted to explain that stealing can base on other issues. And that her not being remorseful at all plus couldn't stop it, could be further hint to such an issue.\n\nWith talking one on one I meant talk to her about the past. Get to know the person she is now. Would she open up immediately? Probably not about all from back then.

If she got fired there had to be other reasons. \n\nMaybe they didn't want to confront her about past issues so they used you being uncomfortable as an excuse or it was a coincidence that she got fired right after seeing you and she needs someone to blame.", "YTA, you have no idea how the intervening years have changed this woman (also wow you\u2019re classist)", "YTA for getting other parents involved.", "NTA.

You expressed concerns about someone you didn't want around your child.\n\nThat being said you didn't get her fired since there is no evidence , police report, etc. to back up your claims. If it factored into the school's decision it was probably as a last straw kind of thing.", "Sounds made up to me, frankly. They wouldn't fire someone based on one person's word from 10+ years ago.", "She probably would not have been fired for cause.  OP is using the word fired and many people do when what probably actually happened (assuming this is a true story) is a lay off without a reason given.  Unless the person was a long-standing or senior employee (doesn\u2019t sound like it) or there was some context to give credence to a discrimination claim, then that would be a simple and inexpensive thing to do.  There may also have been other complaints or circumstances.  People like that rarely change.", "> Why is bad behavior not supposed to reveal character if it happened years ago as opposed to yesterday?\n\nThis may be the most Reddit thing I\u2019ve ever seen when you\u2019re talking about someone in college vs them as a 30 year old adult.", "Decent chance the theft isn't the issue, the attitude is. Saying you deserve to have things taken is maybe not the best kind of mindset for someone that works with kids", "See the thing is whether the other mothers believed you or not they literally can't fire her over this because you provided no proof and that makes it a potential wrongful termination and possible defamation suit. \n\nThere had to be other issues for her to be fired over.", "Where do you live? I\u2019m in Florida and private school teachers make more and get better benefits. I know 4 teachers.", "> We pay them a lot for our children to go to the school and we expect to be completely satisfied.\n\nIncredibly entitled behavior.", "Same way in parts of Georgia/Missouri....", "And so the administrators fired her based on one person's word with no proof. It's not even a sex accusation (which would be more understandable for them to jump the gun at), they fired her for one person saying she was a thief a decade ago.\n\n...Sounds a tad farfetched."]}
