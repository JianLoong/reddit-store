OP is using the word fired and many people do when what probably actually happened (assuming this is a true story) is a lay off without a reason given.  Unless the person was a long-standing or senior employee (doesn\u2019t sound like it) or there was some context to give credence to a discrimination claim, then that would be a simple and inexpensive thing to do.

Steal a box of crayons from little Timmy? You\u2019re making an assumption that I feel borders on some kind of personal vendetta. \n\nThe reason you\u2019re the asshole is that you went out of your way 10 years later still holding some kind of personal grudge. To make the assumption that she has not changed at all is not how the world works. You could\u2019ve talked to her and asked her \u201cI\u2019m worried you will steal again, be honest, have you recently stolen anything ever since then? Looking back at that time, do you feel bad about it?\u201d There is a fine line difference between having someone answer for their crimes and personally hating that person for their crimes. \n\nShe\u2019s definitely in the wrong for all the terrible things she\u2019s done, but you chose to carry out some personal vendetta against this person. To me, you\u2019re not better than her. For all we know, she might\u2019ve never stolen after that. Maybe she now has a dog that she cares for really well. Maybe she did steal but you\u2019re never going to know. How could you know? Do you have some telepathic power that we\u2019re not aware of? You have zero proof to know if her behaviors continued! You literally discriminated against her as soon as you made eye contact. \u201cHow dare this person do something good and be a special needs teacher, when I know she did a couple things 10 YEARS AGO\u201d. She probably tried very hard getting that job and possibly feels super guilty over it. Judging by her reaction, you probably acted in a way where she felt you hated her guts. God forbid you ever steal something or commit some crime \n\nBy your logic a teenager that stole a box of chocolates or kicked a dog should face their crime for eternity! In the same manner that people have a choice to change their behavior, you had the choice to forgive this person and instead you held some weird obsessive and personal vendetta against her for 10 YEARS! Unlike you though, I hope you find the strength to forgive yourself and her as well.", "YTA based on your comment replies. A lot of this doesn\u2019t add up.", "NTA, but I am very very surprised that she got fired due to this.

You got her livelihood taken away because she was stupid in college.", "NTA. I doubt your story got her fired, but was likely a log on an already burning fire. \n\nYou already know her character pretty well. It's unlikely her arrogant, entitled attitude has changed much since those days.

Even if it takes a long time, the consequences are there and can play out in unexpected ways. The world is smaller than you expect, and people's memories are longer than you expect.", "Not necessarily. It's easy to fire when a mob of paying customers forms.\n\nMuch much easier to boot her and get another one. Specially since its a well paying position in a low paying field.", "I mean if it\u2019s a well paying daycare attended by OP who seems well off, it might really just be that exclusive. Daycares in general might not fire over this but super fancy private ones definitely might.", "100%.  She was likely already on thin ice to get fired over an accusation that's a decade old.  When someone gets fired due to an allegation without evidence, it's usually because it fits a well known pattern that they're already been caught doing IME.  Or they've been really out of line and management is looking for an excuse.\n\nI say this from experience as a recovering alcoholic.  If you get caught once doing something bad and given another chance, the next time they don't need hard evidence because you're lucky you weren't fired the first time.", "What a strange stance. It seems like you have the same perspective of the thief, that they are a spoiled rich kid who deserved to be robbed, I don\u2019t see why else you would defend this nasty person so much. This person committed a crime, as an adult, that would have resulted in a felony, and wasn\u2019t sorry, but felt JUSTIFIED doing it and defended it, and you seem to be doing the same. And adult, living on her own, away from her parents, sneaking around and robbing people.  When the crime was commit, they weren\u2019t too young to know better. They defended committing a crime against \u201cspoiled rich kids.\u201d 10 years of time doesn\u2019t change that, especially when she works a low paying profession, and now she has to tend to \u201cspoiled rich kids.\u201d This isn\u2019t an issue of rich people being unfair to poor people. OPs feelings of being uncomfortable with this person are valid and they shouldn\u2019t have to be made to change schools because their small child\u2019s educator is a legit criminal. This person was lucky to even have this job in the first place, had OP and the other roommates call the cops, the roommate might have a felony on their record right now and would have and even harder time finding employment. The criminal should have made better choices. Even so, other parents didn\u2019t like this person, they have a terrible attitude, so I don\u2019t think your point of them being a different person than 10 years ago applies here.

You riled up a group of parents to aid in your attempt to seek justice for an offense she committed years ago.

Now you are capitalizing on the opportunity to dish out a punishment that you believe is worthy of the past offense. This could have been an opportunity for growth and reconciliation but you chose neither. I don't believe that you never considered that a result of a large number of parents coming to the administration with their concerns about the safety of children that it wouldn't end with her losing her job.
