OP is using the word fired and many people do when what probably actually happened (assuming this is a true story) is a lay off without a reason given.

Steal a box of crayons from little Timmy? You\u2019re making an assumption that I feel borders on some kind of personal vendetta. \n\nThe reason you\u2019re the asshole is that you went out of your way 10 years later still holding some kind of personal grudge. To make the assumption that she has not changed at all is not how the world works. You could\u2019ve talked to her and asked her \u201cI\u2019m worried you will steal again, be honest, have you recently stolen anything ever since then? Looking back at that time, do you feel bad about it?\u201d There is a fine line difference between having someone answer for their crimes and personally hating that person for their crimes. \n\nShe\u2019s definitely in the wrong for all the terrible things she\u2019s done, but you chose to carry out some personal vendetta against this person. To me, you\u2019re not better than her. For all we know, she might\u2019ve never stolen after that. Maybe she now has a dog that she cares for really well. Maybe she did steal but you\u2019re never going to know. How could you know? Do you have some telepathic power that we\u2019re not aware of? You have zero proof to know if her behaviors continued! You literally discriminated against her as soon as you made eye contact. \u201cHow dare this person do something good and be a special needs teacher, when I know she did a couple things 10 YEARS AGO\u201d. She probably tried very hard getting that job and possibly feels super guilty over it. Judging by her reaction, you probably acted in a way where she felt you hated her guts. God forbid you ever steal something or commit some crime \n\nBy your logic a teenager that stole a box of chocolates or kicked a dog should face their crime for eternity! In the same manner that people have a choice to change their behavior, you had the choice to forgive this person and instead you held some weird obsessive and personal vendetta against her for 10 YEARS! Unlike you though, I hope you find the strength to forgive yourself and her as well.", "YTA based on your comment replies.

I doubt your story got her fired, but was likely a log on an already burning fire. \n\nYou already know her character pretty well. It's unlikely her arrogant, entitled attitude has changed much since those days. So it's not difficult to imagine that there were other things happening and then your message might have been one of the final straws. \n\nIt's a good lesson for EVERYONE. Actions have consequences. Even if it takes a long time, the consequences are there and can play out in unexpected ways. The world is smaller than you expect, and people's memories are longer than you expect.", "Not necessarily.

Daycares in general might not fire over this but super fancy private ones definitely might.", "100%.  She was likely already on thin ice to get fired over an accusation that's a decade old.  When someone gets fired due to an allegation without evidence, it's usually because it fits a well known pattern that they're already been caught doing IME.  Or they've been really out of line and management is looking for an excuse.\n\nI say this from experience as a recovering alcoholic.  If you get caught once doing something bad and given another chance, the next time they don't need hard evidence because you're lucky you weren't fired the first time.", "What a strange stance. It seems like you have the same perspective of the thief, that they are a spoiled rich kid who deserved to be robbed, I don\u2019t see why else you would defend this nasty person so much. This person committed a crime, as an adult, that would have resulted in a felony, and wasn\u2019t sorry, but felt JUSTIFIED doing it and defended it, and you seem to be doing the same. And adult, living on her own, away from her parents, sneaking around and robbing people.  When the crime was commit, they weren\u2019t too young to know better. They defended committing a crime against \u201cspoiled rich kids.\u201d 10 years of time doesn\u2019t change that, especially when she works a low paying profession, and now she has to tend to \u201cspoiled rich kids.\u201d This isn\u2019t an issue of rich people being unfair to poor people. OPs feelings of being uncomfortable with this person are valid and they shouldn\u2019t have to be made to change schools because their small child\u2019s educator is a legit criminal. This person was lucky to even have this job in the first place, had OP and the other roommates call the cops, the roommate might have a felony on their record right now and would have and even harder time finding employment. The criminal should have made better choices. Even so, other parents didn\u2019t like this person, they have a terrible attitude, so I don\u2019t think your point of them being a different person than 10 years ago applies here.

You all but said the word.", "So your ex-roomate has somehow earned a reputation at this school for her less than desirable interactions and rude attitude with both parents and students but the administration has yet to address these grievances --that seems unlikely especially. And also you said you were in a mommy group chat and none of the others moms have discussed the complaints about her from their children --also highly unlikely. You riled up a group of parents to aid in your attempt to seek justice for an offense she committed years ago. It's apparent that you don't feel as if she was adequately punished or suffered enough for those offenses. Now you are capitalizing on the opportunity to dish out a punishment that you believe is worthy of the past offense. This could have been an opportunity for growth and reconciliation but you chose neither. I don't believe that you never considered that a result of a large number of parents coming to the administration with their concerns about the safety of children that it wouldn't end with her losing her job. The administration was faced with the options of punishing an employee for making poor decisions years ago prior to employment or deal with the financial implications if parents chose to remove their children from the school...", "YTA. You don't fully know what her struggles were in college. Obviously she managed to finish her education and land a spot at a prestigious school after parting ways with you, so in some fashion she must've cleaned up her act and/or gotten the help she needed to succeed. Maybe it took better influences, therapy, meds, that one professor who makes a difference.\n\nYou might not be mature enough yet to realize that people can change and grow, and who you are at 20 is nothing like who you become at 30. The human brain keeps maturing and growing until 26, not 18 or 21.\n\nInstead of considering how she might've turned her life around, you immediately jumped on the gossip train with other privileged parents who expect people to scrape and bow with graced with your attention, arrived with a united front, and possibly ruined that woman's life over what she did a decade ago without spending one second finding out who she is as an adult.\n\nGrow up.", "My thoughts exactly, or if they did fire her for it they are asking for a wrongful termination lawsuit.", "As a special ed para no less- so working with the most vulnerable members of the schools population.", "Or other items have accidentally gone missing and now they are wondering if it is her.", "> There had to be other issues for her to be fired over.\n\nPrivate school.  Wants to keep tuition.  Parents say.  \"I don't want X in classroom with my kid.\"  X is no longer there.   \n    \nPretty simple.  A class helper.  Or a bunch of pissed off parents.", "I think you may be underestimating the willingness of employers to do things that could theoretically result in wrongful termination suits. If employers never wrongfully terminated anyone, there would be no wrongful termination suits. And, frankly, there are probably far more wrongful terminations than wrongful termination suits.", "I\u2019m a teacher and am in multiple teaching groups on different social medias. I\u2019ve literally never encountered a teacher say that. I\u2019m sure it happens for the 1% of upper upper upper class schools, but it\u2019s definitely rare and not the norm.", "In states with good quality education, they don't pay well or give good benefits.", "Or maybe she had been stealing already or dong something else but they had nothing but a vague idea of who it might be and the accusations sped up the process.\n\nOr maybe these were the last reports in a long list of other reports made by other unsatisfied parents. Both are possible, too.", "Yeah, I imagine a few kids may have had stuff disapear. \n\nA lot of special needs kids use tablets to communicate- text to speech and soundboards can be godsends and at a rich person school I'm expecting expensive tablets like IPad- and she's a special ed para.\n\nShe'd have access, opportunity,and is in a position of power over potential victims.", "She's a para-educator that was NOT in OPs child's classroom and OP offered absolutely no proof whatsoever as there was no police report so it's just the word of a few parents that were not involved in the supposed incident that got her fired. \n\nI'm not saying she didn't get fired for another reason(assuming this is even true which I have doubts) but if they fire her over hearsay from nearly a decade ago they risk a very costly wrongful termination lawsuit and if they actually told her this was the reason and it effects her ability to work elsewhere, since again there was no proof provided, then that could also be classified under defamation on both the school and OP.", "I think you're overestimating the likelihood that a school(public or private) would fire someone over simple hearsay from a couple parents about an incident that was nearly a decade ago with absolutely zero evidence. \n\nAs I said I'm not saying there weren't other reasons (I stated in another comment I'm not convinced this is even true) but I find it hard to believe that one parent's unsubstantiated story from almost 10 years ago would be enough to get her fired.", ">  She's a para-educator that was NOT in OPs child's classroom   \n    \nThe below quote.  Directly from the OPs post.  In the child's classroom.    \n    \n>  imagine my complete and utter surprise when yesterday I go and pick up my son and when I enter his classroom I see the same thief from college in the room.    \n    \n>  OP offered absolutely no proof whatsoever as there was no police report so it's just the word of a few parents that were not involved in the supposed incident that got her fired.   \n    \nNotice.  I explained why.  With no proof.  The school might fire someone.  Rather than lose tuition.  A classroom helper.  Just not worth angry parents.   \n    \n>  but if they fire her over hearsay from nearly a decade ago they risk a very costly wrongful termination lawsuit   \n    \nI would assume.  The school is smart enough.  To use behavior towards other parents.  Other documented issues.  Many other reasons.  As the official reason.   \n    \nIn a lot of private schools.  Just being nasty to parents.  Is enough to get you dismissed.", "So, are you missing the fact that the para-educator actually WAS in the son\u2019s classroom? Like, OP said in this comment chain that you are responding to that she complained because she didn\u2019t want someone who thinks people deserve to be stolen from because of their family\u2019s financial background and who has current attitude issues with the parents at the school in the classroom with her child. Like, can you not read or use reading comprehension?", "I mean\u2026there\u2019s a pretty obvious power differential here. I just do not have a hard time believing that a private school which is unlikely to have unionized teachers would fire a teacher on the basis of the shaky and unproven allegations of an organized group of parents.", "So administration wouldn't be firing over just one thing. There probably have been other things happening causing them to make a case and fire her.  We don't know how many other infractions this teacher had. \n\nIn other comments from OP the other mothers were reporting her nasty behavior to the children and at drop off and pick up times. \n\nI'm thinking it was more of a building case than just an outright firing over an accusation.", "Then wouldn't that fall under EXACTLY what I said that there had to be other reasons for her to get terminated over.\n\nI'm a little confused (unless you're just cherry picking or didn't bother reading my other comments)  over what you're even arguing over since your last paragraph basically agrees with my assessment. \n\nI literally said throughout this thread and in other comment threads there had to be other reasons for termination in which case OPs assessment is wrong and she DIDN'T even get her fired.", "So you're going to insult my reading comprehension about something that yes I admittedly missed, but you obviously couldn't read that she had zero evidence whatsoever . Like can you not read it use reading comprehension", "The part that I find hard to believe is that there wouldn't be OTHER DOCUMENTED reasons for her to get fired. It just sounds far fetched that an entirely unprovable story from a decade ago would be enough to get someone terminated.", "Who gives a flying fuck about evidence? Most places are at will. On top of that without even knowing you I know you're not an employment lawyer. Stop throwing around wrongful termination nobody is getting sued.", "They can fire you because the boss doesn't like the color of your shoes. As long as it's not protected under law and you're in an at will state they can use whatever reason they want- even if it's stupid.", "You think at-will means you can be slandered without proof? Even at-will employees can file wrongful termination suits if there's proof that they were defamed or discriminated against.\n\nIf there are other issues that can or have been documented then I could buy it, but if OP is trying to say that an unprovable story from almost 10 years ago is enough to get someone fired then that's a bunch of BS", "Most normal and sane people actually do want some evidence to back up an allegation.", ">Even at-will employees can file wrongful termination suits if there's proof that they were defamed or discriminated against.\n\nYou clearly know nothing about employment law.\n\nYou can be discriminated against for any reason- as long as it's not a protected reason (race, gender, sexuality, nationality, disability, age, religion, ect).\n\nWrongful termination applies to things like being injured at work, or fired for reporting something to HR, or fired for reporting something illegal to police- not \"people who pay us a lot of money don't like you\" and \"someone who knows you has contacted us with serous accusations so we're going to have to let you go\".\n\nDefamation would not apply to the school- the schools not defamaning her by firing her. She'd have a case against OP- and maybe the other parents- but defamation requires libel and/or slander. A private business entity terminating employment because their customers are upset with someone being on staff does not count.\n\nAll of this is super basic stuff- maybe work on your reading comprehension some and then go actually read the law?"]}
