I went to a Jesuit law school with no religious component unless you chose to participate (Red Mass, etc.). If this is a hardcore evangelical college, I'd be 100 percent in agreement.", "NTA I\u2019m not saying all religiously affiliated institutions are bad. I\u2019m a Muslim who sent to a Jesuit university and I loved it and thrived in that environment. But there was no focus on conversion at that school, theology courses were required but were an academic study, not religious instruction, of various religions, and their values did not conflict with how I was raised even if specific theology or rules were obviously different. Sounds like you are being offered a school which exists to perpetuate and expand on a particular faith and it was done for the reason of exposing and luring your kids to be involved.

Atheist here who went to catholic university.  If you do a good job raising your kids they will already be free thinkers by the time the go to college and not be brainwashed.  Also we had a significant Muslim student body along with other religions, catholic university is very different from catholic grade school (at least I assume catholic grade school is more of what you\u2019re thinking of).  \n\nI agree that choosing a university for your kids go to at this point is looking way to far in advance, and you don\u2019t know what they will want at this point, but you can leave that option open instead of being a dick to your FIL.", "ESH\nLeave it up to the kids to decide where they will or won't go to college.", "It meets all the criteria of a cult, popularity is the sole basis of acceptabilitt.
