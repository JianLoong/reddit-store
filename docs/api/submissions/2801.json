How do you know that your FIL will still be around once your potential child will be of age to go to university? Or if he will still be with his wife at that point? It's like creating drama over something that will or might never be happening", ">In europe there is a seperation of education and relgion .\n\nEurope's made up of a lot of countries and a lot of them allow religious schools", "You might be wary of letting them babysit the kids on church days.

Bravo!!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "\ud83c\udfc5 Please take my poor man's gold.", "I went to a Baptist graduate school, and they didn't have direct religion in it. they had a church but didn't require religious classes or directly talk about God. we had a few professors who talked about it, but our classes were for our career and to get our license. we were taught to keep religion separated unless we wanted to have a religious license and practice", "Fair enough I don't know everywhere in the EU. But I was under the impression that EU member states had had like an education standards thing. I know here in the UK we have a governing body which keeps an eye on independent school syllabus and homeschoolers when theres kids under 16 involved. They cant just teach whatever they want.", "Correct me if I am wrong, but are you guys arguing about kids that have not eventuated?\nI believe in being prepared but wow!!! Life is too short to argue like this, doesn\u2019t the future offspring get a say or have you organised it\u2019s potential life and put a neat little bow on it?", "NTA. If his wife\u2019s faith is so important to him, why doesn\u2019t he convert? You protecting your kids\u2019 religious freedom and setting boundaries is huge.", "My MIL (since passed away) once tried to get me to go see her pastor. We were sitting outside. She and I were talking about generalities. My husband and his father were talking about 15\u2019 away. She asked me about my boss who had tragically died. She asked me if he had been a Christian. I told her I didn\u2019t know. She then asked if I was. I, very nicely, told her I would not discuss that. Then she asked if she could take me to talk to her pastor. I looked her in the eye and repeated I was not going to discuss this.  She then backed off. I hate when people try to push their religion on others.", "INFO:  was this an accredited educational institution like BYU? A farce like Liberty University?  Or something in between like Harding University?", "NTA - this is all kinds of strange\n\ndidn't FIL sound silly proposing this education when he isn't even a member of that faith? Clearly everybody in the family has a different religion and accepting that is the only way your family can work.  \n\nAttempting conversion isn't a good idea", "You know what happens in Europe isn\u2019t the same worldwide? Even in Canada we have private universities with theological foundations. Brigham Young University in the US is a massive school that is geared around Christian Mormonism. Just because it doesn\u2019t exist in Europe doesn\u2019t mean that is consistent in the rest of the world. \n\nAnd honestly, if you saw news out of North America, you\u2019d see a rampant movement to increase the influence of conservative religious values into politics. It sucks but it\u2019s not unique.", "This is a gross overgeneralization. Italy public schools are required to teach religion classes, and Greek schools as well.", "At least 2 have mandatory religious education. \ud83d\ude44", "This is awesome! I hope I live to see the day where this is the rule rather than the exception. I ended up going to a Catholic middle school (in the USA) and as a person who was not from a Catholic family it was very uncomfortable to say the least. My mom used to say, \"Take what serves you, and leave the rest.\" Sometimes I think that's the only thing that got me through those years.\n\nEdit: location", "I was going to say YTA for snapping at him instead of just being firm but polite.  But if this is what you\u2019re being subjected to nonstop, ugh.  No.", "You just won the internet.", "I was thinking the same. I wouldn't mind *my (imaginary) kids going to Notre Dame, Boston College, or BYU but any of the ones you mentioned wouldn't see any money from me.\n\n*Please note, I am actually child free, my only kids are a spoiled dog and a spoiled bird.", "The BC government funds Catholic schools at 50%.", "BYU would be on my no list.", "Oh ok like all independent schools in BC.", "In Poland we have at least 2 catholic universities. Not that they are any good.", "Not a fan of their faith message, at least the actual education would be from a real, accredited university.", "Do they only teach within the Catholic belief system or are they just Catholic funded? I googled it after writing above cos I was interested and it did list Eastern EU as having objections to religious education restrictions along with a couple of parties dotted around. \n\nHonestly didn't know the UK system was so protected tbf, I'm so used to everything with us being bad news haha", "The other schools I mentioned are accredited.   I don\u2019t think they provide a quality educational experience, but they\u2019re accredited.", "\u201cWell then we\u2019ll have to turn down your otherwise generous offer. I would want my kids to go to whichever school is best for their chosen major, not their grandparents\u2019 chosen religion.\u201d But NTA", "NTA in principle but you could have handled it better especially considering the kids aren\u2019t even \u201caround\u201d yet. \n\nThis isn\u2019t going to end unfortunately. I have a 1 year old and my parents are relentlessly trying to him Catholic.

They are very upset and offer to take him to church when we spend the weekend with them. My mom buys him religious books and stuffed dolls of Mary (can\u2019t make this stuff up). It drives my wife and I nuts but we tend to ignore most of it (we even let them take him to church occasionally so we can sleep in). \n\nMy father has also set up education funds for all of his grandkids (no stipulations) but he did encourage us to think of sending him to a catholic school. We said we would consider. \n\n1 because I do not think a school can brainwash a kid if the parents offer a balance perspective at home. \n\n2 there are actually some very good catholic schools out there that I would be more then happy to see my son attend. \n\n3 it\u2019s not worth the fight now. They are his grandparents and they love him. They are miss guided in their insistence on religion (IMO) but there hearts are in the right place.", "This is presumptuous. -Edited punctuation. We\u2019re considering adopting as part of our family planning.", "Just because it's popular doesn't mean it doesn't have cult aspects- your MIL's imposing evangelical ways and offering education but with strings re religion attached are pretty damn cultish, right?", "All religions are cults, they\u2019ve just become socially accepted cults.", "Ah, that religion. I wouldn't send my kids there, either!!", "Gifts with strings are never kind gestures.", "Are there jehovah witness universities?  I\u2019ve never heard of that.", "You aren\u2019t entitled to his money. If he will only pay for certain schools, then that\u2019s that.

From the actual UK government website: \u201cFaith schools have to follow the national curriculum, but they can choose what they teach in religious studies.\u201d\n\nAlso, from a Parliamentary report: \u201cCurrently, around one third of state-funded schools in England have a faith designation.\u201d \n\nThere are also faith academies which do not have to teach the national curriculum.", "He ignores them bc he knows it\u2019s not happening.", "Does the religion involve some sort of baptism ritual? If so, I guarantee they'll try to sneak the first kid away and get an unethical clergyperson to perform the ceremony without your knowledge.", "No idea, to be honest. Everybody can study there, regardless of religious affiliation but how it looks in practice, I don't know.", "I don't know how I mean to word it. Prestige, maybe? Oral Roberts University might as well be Trump University, to me. Even if they are accredited, I can't imagine anyone takes that diploma seriously outside of a faith based business.", "Do those universities turn out inferior graduates that you encounter regularly enough to know they're badly educated? lack professional knowledge?", "They have low publication results, when I was still in academia, I would never meet them at the conferences. Back then, when we still had entry exams, the acceptance threshold was low."]}
