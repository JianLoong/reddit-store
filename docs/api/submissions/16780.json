It\u2019s absurd to accuse you of abusing your children. The way you describe it you are very thoughtful about their needs \u2014 even giving up your bedroom so they can be together. I honestly think you\u2019re doing your kids a disservice if you separate them just to make your family happy.

You aren\u2019t playing favourites, because you have rooms ready for when they do want the privacy of their own room. I\u2019d send out a group message to all the people harassing, tell exactly how things are, and anyone continuing to act like they know better will be promptly blocked on all platforms.", "I guess I see your sisters perspective because I could not dream of choosing to live that way BUT she needs to remember it\u2019s what works for your family. \n\nHowever, could you offer your other children there own room again now? They\u2019ll probably say no but at least that way you aren\u2019t \u2018favouring\u2019 one child over the others.", "NTA, mostly because it sounds like this situation developed from their preferences/habits and they can opt out of it when they desire. You\u2019re not forcing them; it sounds like something they want for now. \n\nBut even if that weren\u2019t the case\u2026being able have enough space to provide five kids with their own rooms is frankly a privilege. If I had five kids, I\u2019d expect 2-3 per bedroom with an oldest having their own room if anyone did. I certainly wouldn\u2019t judge anyone unable to provide each kid with their own room. Most houses just aren\u2019t built for it. It\u2019s certainly not abuse to share rooms; it\u2019s probably been the norm for far longer than the opposite. \n\nAnd honestly a benefit to your set up is if they mostly just sleep in the shared bedroom, you can use the other rooms for more concentrated purpose/activity spaces which also sounds pretty beneficial to the family as a whole. \n\nYour sister needs therapy and to mind her own business. It sounds like she\u2019s making a lot of assumptions and projecting her own insecurities. Did y\u2019all have to share a room as kids?", "NTA. I still cherish the memories from my childhood when with my cousins we would share a bedroom in the summer while staying at my grandparents (we were actually sharing a huge double bed, but were pre-teen at the time), telling stories before going to bed, sharing things, thoughts. It is a great bonding time. You sister has no clue about your children's relationship so don't let her narrow opinions affect you. A good idea might be to place a second single bed in your eldest daughter room though, since in 2 years probably the next sister will join her there and it might also allow \"sleepovers\" with her, if she feels like it ;)", "NTA I'm from a family of 6 kids.  We all shared a room at some point (but we also kinda had to). So long as your kids are happy with the arrangement there isn't a problem. It sounds like you'd be open to them having their own room if they expressed a need for it and will continue to give them their own rooms as they get older.  So no problems there.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to have your children share a bedroom, especially when they are young. You went above and beyond by creating a special space for your oldest daughter and keeping a daybed in the shared room for her sisters to use. It's clear that you're trying to balance your children's needs for privacy with their desires to be close to one another. Your sister's criticism seems unwarranted, especially since she's not the one raising five kids.  \nIt's also important to note that your children seem happy with the current arrangement. If they were unhappy sharing a room, that would be a different story. You've also made it clear that your children have other spaces in the house where they can be alone if they need to be.  \nIn short, don't let your sister's criticism get to you. You know your family's needs best, and you've made a thoughtful decision that works for everyone.", "NTA. What's up with your sister? Did you piss her off while you were growing up or something? Seems like she's going out of her way to hate you.", "NTA Your sister needs to mind her own business. If your kids are happy with the sleeping arrangements and it works for your family then why mess with it and worry about it just because your sister is butting in where she doesn't belong? Tell your sister your children are happy and how you and your husband raise them is up to you and your husband and not her. Tell her to go back to her lane and stay put.", "NTA. If your kids are okay with it, who cares? I had to share a large room with three sisters and both parents for a time (granted, we didn't really have a choice) and we survived just fine. Room sharing might be less common these days, but it isn't some terrible act of abuse if everyone's comfortable. So long as the kids can be open with you in the future if they want privacy, things seem fine as they are.", "NTA. My kids shared a room and enjoyed it. You know what works for your family. I think setting up a nice space for your oldest was a lovely idea. That way she can have some privacy as she gets into her teen years, when needed. And clearly she doesn't want to be too far, as she requested a spare bed in the original room. I think if your kids were fighting a lot and hated the arrangement, it might be different. But it sounds like you have a culture of closeness in your home. You're raising nice young humans.", "NTA. Your sister seems but*hurt. The bedroom dynamics will change as they grow (eventually boys and girls may be in different rooms, some may move out, granted in a few more years). My kids shared beds and bedrooms most of their childhood and they're happy with their settings. My eldest has their own room now and it works.\n\nWhat you do with your kids is your problem, not your whiny sister's. Don't worry about it.", "I'll say it's at 13 years old that teens need to have privacy. Before that, it's not really a problem, they are all the same sex, there is no tension (from what op said). Giving a personal room at 10 is quite a good method, I think.  \nNTA", "It was. My eldest was growing a little annoyed with all of the kids around her at night and when I noticed it, I sat the kids down and told them that having their own room was 100% a choice I would support their decision either way and it didn\u2019t mean that they loved their siblings less. That\u2019s when my daughter expressed that she didn\u2019t know if she was ready but wanted to try having her own room. That\u2019s why part of her birthday present was furniture and paint for the bedroom", "I think it\u2019s because my family grew up poor. Me and my sister were crammed into a really small room and didn\u2019t have the option of having our own space because of how small our house was(we literally joked that we lived in a dollhouse) I tried to explain that my kids chose this and I gave them multiple options to say no and still encourage them to speak up if they don\u2019t like the arrangement. However, even I had doubts because of my childhood so I\u2019m doubtful that I would be able to get through to her anytime soon", "My husband and I have a 5 bedroom house plus a finished basement that can be used as a room if needed. I originally planned to have my kids each have their own room but the rooms are split between two floors and when my kids started going into each others bedrooms at night I was afraid of one of them falling down the stairs because they would often bring their comforters with them. That\u2019s when I suggested giving all of them the master bedroom until they were ready to be on their own or at least old enough that I don\u2019t worry as much when they are traveling up and down the stairs at night.", "When I noticed my oldest was growing and showing a need for privacy, I didn\u2019t want to single her out so I sat all of the kids down for a family meeting and encouraged them to tell me if they needed more space and I would gladly do that. That\u2019s when my oldest spoke up and the rest looked at me like I was crazy lol so I guess they\u2019re not ready just yet", "Thank you! I always try to remind my kids to be grateful of the position we\u2019re in. My family grew up poor and crammed together in a very tiny house. I worked hard and went through a lot of therapy to make sure I could give my family a better life then I had. I\u2019m sure my sister still hold some resentment to how we grew up", "Then double N T A from me, you are giving the kids agency and choice, im sure many many people who had to share with siblings would have loved the choice.", "It sounds like you\u2019re doing great for your kids \u2014 considering their preferences and adjusting as you go along. I honestly think your girls will have great memories of sharing that bedroom and are probably closer as a result.", "OMG, this one is so fucking simple to figure out.  ASK YOUR FUCKING KIDS HOW THEY WANT IT.  If the kids want to be in 1 room, then no issue.  If they want their own rooms, then do it.  If some want to share and others want their own rooms, then split up those that want it.\n\nThis way, your not forcing anything on anyone.  Then your sister can go fuck herself because it was determined by the kids themselves.", "Okay I have no other suggestions the haha!", "Sounds like that's exactly what OP did but the sister still somehow has a problem with it", "Ima go NTA, \n\nYou said your kids WANTED to be in the same room, and you even gave you eldest her own room so that as they grew they wouldnt feel forced together...\n\nYou EVEN gave the there own 'safe zones' so they can be alone when needed..\n\nTbh idk your sisters living situation, but shes def jealous of your parenting skills :)", "Your kids will 100% tell you themselves when they need privacy. You are clearly give them options and are just respectful of their choices. I think it\u2019s lovely", "NTA. The best parents talk \"with\" not \"to\" their children.", "INFO Did you EXPLICITLY ask each of your children what they prefer? It seems odd to me to cramp all kids in one room if you have space to give them their own space and privacy but if they rather sleep together than alone then obviously there\u2019s no problem.", "While it certainly isn't \"abuse\" if your kids wanted to have a room together, I must admit I think it's preferable for each kid to have their own space.  Not just for privacy reasons, but because it's good for them to have a space where they can exercise some degree of control over.  Your kids are young enough that it's not a big deal, but I think within the next few years you'll probably see an exodus.", "Nta. The echo others, follow your kids lead. Some kids enjoy sharing a room. My 2 girls share a room currently (4 and 2) because the oldest couldn't stand being alone and the younger loves it too. Some kids just enjoy others company. I shared a room with my twin my whole childhood. We were offered our own rooms at 14 when my brother moves out but we stayed together because we prefer it. The fact that yall have the room for each to get their own room is great. Just wait until they say something. You are doing the right thing!", "Info:\n\n\"Hoarding rooms for yourself\" is a weird comment to make. How many bedrooms does your house have and what are you using them for. While it seems you children like the sleeping arrangement, there should be more rooms for them. If all children stuff is packed in one room, while you still have a gaming room, sports room and a room for your collection of Brooms, this would put you in AH territory. That being said:\n\nThere is one rule, that stood for eternity.\n\n**The eldest child at home gets the largest room/ her own room first.** \n\nIs it always fair? No, but it is as it is. Though I probably would not keep her daybed in the master bedroom to make a clear cut.", "NTA- sounds like you have a great plan here! I would be proud that my kids enjoy each other so much they want to share rooms. \nYour sister claiming that you favor your oldest is just ridiculous, she\u2019s the oldest and probably need a separate space first, and I also guess the other kids can have room whenever they want it! \nHonestly it sounds like your sister has issues from her own childhood she\u2019s projecting on your kids. \nKeep up the good work, it\u2019s way better to listen to your kids and see their needs, than doing what random people (or your sister/parents in this case) think is right.", "NTA it's none of her business. YOUR children are happy and that's all that matters", " NTA What you\u2019ve described sounds like a nightmare to me now, but my sister and I were like this well into high school and I vividly remember thinking this was awesome as a child. Kids are fucking weird, I thought we all figured that out when we were kids!", "NTA. Are your kids happy with the current arrangement? THen what is your sister complaining about?", "NTA, if everyone's happy, then the arrangement is fine!", "So your family have an issue with you giving your daughters what they want and making everyone happy and not hurting a single person in doing so? How on earth does this make sense? your family sound mind blowingly crazy with all there stupid opinions.", "I wanted to make sure anything in the extra bedrooms could be easily moved into our living room or just gotten rid of if/when my kids are ready for their own room. Our family lives in a 5 bedroom house and a finished basement that I plan to turn into a bedroom if needed. In list of size the bedrooms are used as children\u2019s bedroom, my husband and my bedroom, the eldest bedroom(formerly a guest bedroom), a playroom area for the kids with their gaming consoles and toys that I don\u2019t want them playing with during down time, and a mini library in the smallest room. The basement is used as storage for our holiday decorations as well", "This is the perfect solution. Absolutely NTA.", "If the mini library also serves as a reading/quiet room for all family members, this sounds like a lovely home.\n\nA room for playing, a room for reading and a room for sleeping. \n\nI honestly cannot understand your families concerns.", "\u2026that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened", "NTA if the kids are happy, that\u2019s what matters.

If you\u2019re so concerned ask them yourself.\u201d\n\nAs a kid who got scared easily I probably would\u2019ve enjoyed this for a while myself.", "NTA It\u2019s not favouring a child by treating her differently due to her age. Each child\u2019s needs and wants will evolve as they mature. Treating a 10yr differently from a 5yr old is good and normal", "NTA. But, have you told your sister that you did this *because* they enjoyed being in each others rooms? Have you explained *why* you guys did this? \n\nI admit, while it\u2019s not her business, having that many kids in one room could be easily seen as problematic enough for an adult to warrant getting involved. If she\u2019s coming at it from a standpoint of genuinely believing  you\u2019re neglecting the kids and this is motivated by selfishness, I can see where she\u2019s coming from. My brother had his three girls in a tiny room so he could have a spare gym room and it was obvious they were miserable. It was hard to watch, and had I not gone NC I would have eventually said something about it. It seems like this is her concern too, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for it. I think there\u2019s a line that gets crossed where \u201cthey\u2019re my kids it\u2019s not your business\u201d doesn\u2019t apply anymore. Having 5 kids in one room when there\u2019s another option could easily be cause for concern. \n\nShe should have just talked to you about it first, or asked about it casually, assuming she hadn\u2019t yet. It didn\u2019t need to escalate to this level, but also I think sometimes parents need to understand that other adults will make reasonable judgments and draw reasonable conclusions that can and will impact your kids. Explaining your reasoning can save a lot of headache.\n\nAll of this is under the assumption that you haven\u2019t explained to her already, if you have then she needs to fuck off lol.", "Nta, however just in case I\u2019d check to see if your location has room occupancy rules. In our state you\u2019re only supposed to have two children of the same gender sharing a room. I can totally understand the convenience of having them in the room with attached bathroom. That was so smart!!", "Honestly, most of the world's children have to share a room, and so do most not middle middle and above children in the USA.  A LOT of parents are overextending themselves financially BECAUSE of the notion that each child gets a solo room.\n\nThe eldest getting a room by herself is fine. When she grows up and moves, the next eldest gets it, and so on, and by the time the last two are there, they each get a solo room. They'll all be well prepped to share a room at college or with roomies later. We'll done mama. NTA", "You gave up the master bedroom so the oldest three could be together. You made a room for your eldest once she needed her own space.

Your girls are lucky to have y\u2019all. A very big NTA.", "Nta if the kids are happy, then it's fine. When the next oldest wants her own space, then you clear out another room for her bed room, just like you did with eldest.", "My nieces actually requested to share a room and turn the extra into a play room. They love it, they say that they're having a sleepover every night!", "Yeah, and if you have two siblings with BFF energy, then they can always ask to share a space together.", "Definitely depends on development stages and not age tbh. Like some kids get their periods at 10, should have some privacy after, not some arbitrary age of 13.", "I'm assuming all the girls have privacy when they pee, getting ones period doesn't suddenly create a greater need for privacy than that. Especially since they're all girls, no potential for a brother to see a tampon and throw a tantrum about girl stuff. There are other reasons they'll want more space and privacy as they grow for sure, but they don't need to be sectioned off as each gets their period lmao. (No that you're saying this, but some people seem to think that way)", "Yes and I said 13 in general, some later and some earlier\u2026 but you know what ? I said 10 was nice not 13. And when I talk about privacy, i talk mostly about sexual privacy\u2026 periods is indeed personal but not something a full bedroom of girls should fear to see", "i actually love the idea of the coming of age birthday, decorate your new bedroom thing", "i wouldnt be surprised if some of them 'move out' then 'move back in' occasionally :)", "Y\u2019all are misinterpreting what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s not about the younger kids not being exposed to it, it\u2019s about giving privacy to an older child going through changes with their body they may not want an audience for.", "That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about tho - not protecting them FROM it, giving her privacy from THEM is the point.", "Happy Cake Day!!!", "I don't see what I misinterpreted, I was simply adding onto your comment. But since you're so insistent, I'll maintain that the period isn't some horrible grotesque thing that your siblings can't look away from. People do not look at a girl and instantly know she is on her period. Source: Grew up sharing a tiny bedroom with 3 girls in an apartment with 1 bathroom, none of us even knew when the others started their periods, we only fought about who's clothes were all over the floor. It would have actually benefitted us greatly to talk about period stuff but it was a different time then. \n\nThere are other reasons she may want her own space, but this does not magically happen at the time when she gets her period, nor is it conditional to having a period, boys go through similar hormonal angst, when do we separate them, after their first boner? The kids all have the offer of their own rooms if they want it, even the oldest still wanted a bed in the old room, this angle is really a non issue.", "Or try the POV that all the younger ones will go through this, and she can either answer questions or refer them to parents for more info. \n\nMenstruation isn't weird or dirty, and it doesn't have to be hidden/treated like it is.", "Omg you are STILL insistent upon it being like some isolation thing!!! When I had my period I just wanted to be left the fuck alone as a kid lol not be around my siblings if given the option, would consider that as a factor if making the decision about a room now for a child.

It has literally nothing to do with societal perception of menstruation or purity or anything, just - if the kid is going through something her siblings are not, she may want to be alone, it is something to consider. That is it!", "So she has to be the de facto body educator? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s about the older child\u2019s comfort not how they can use her experience to parent the younger ones, yikes.\n\nAnd again - this is about an older child perhaps WANTING privacy, y\u2019all are projecting or reading way too much into \u201cmenstruation should be hidden\u201d lol no? Of course it shouldn\u2019t, but when one kid is going through something their comfort is the priority."]}
