I took her to a bunch of different stores and completely re-did a bedroom to make it just for her. The kids all seemed happy with this arrangement and I thought that this was the end. However, my younger sister (27f) has always made petty remarks about our bedroom situation and how she disapproves. This came to a head when she found out I had given the oldest her own room.

If your children are happy and understanding of the arrangement, who cares what your sister has to say about it? It\u2019s not her children and not her house. As your kids get older they might want more privacy but considering your oldest is only 10 Im sure you have plenty of time to get it all sorted. I shared a room with my big sister until I was 12 and I never felt like my childhood was ruined or anything. You\u2019re doing the best you can! Don\u2019t let others ruin your happiness.", "NTA, while having that many kids in one room is a knee jerk AH for a lot of people, if they\u2019re happy it doesn\u2019t matter.  You recognized they wanted to share space when they were small and worked to make that happen, good mom move! \n\nAs they get older this is gonna change and you\u2019ve already preempted a problem as your oldest begins to crave more privacy. You\u2019ve done everything right here, though I\u2019d make sure your kids all know that if they don\u2019t want to share anymore, at any point in time, that they don\u2019t have to. My sister and I liked sharing a room at 7 and 9. By 9 and 11 we were ready to tear each others throats out but our mother didn\u2019t want us to move rooms (plenty of space to). \n\nIt\u2019s all about working with your kids to make them all happy and listening to their wants.", "NTA. if your kids are happy with this arrangement, i don\u2019t see why it\u2019s anybody\u2019s business to comment on it.", "NTA...if your kids are happy and not in any danger, it's none of your sister's business.", "NTA as you describe it and as long as the kids do have an option for some space (like going to another room to read quietly by themselves) when they want some, i think its a great idea.\n\nAlso i hope the own room isnt hard age limited but instead its when they express the interest in their own place.", "NTA. You are supporting them in sharing a room together as long as it works for them, and if it\u2019s working for you guys and everyone is happy it doesn\u2019t matter that other people don\u2019t like it. Tell them to mind their own business", "NTA! You're giving them a choice and they choose to be together. It's really sweet that they love each other that much.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing what works for you and it's not a bad thing at all.  They can mind their own business.\n\nYou are going to run out of bedrooms to give the other kids.  That might cause friction later.", "Omg NTA. You do what works for YOUR family. If your kids are happy, good. If not, you sound like a good parent who will listen and figure it out. Your sister and parents have no right to comment.", "NTA \u2014 A lot of kids like sharing bedrooms with their siblings. It\u2019s odd that your sister is so invested in where your kids sleep and now even has your parents involved. Is your sister projecting some of her own personal issues into this situation?  It\u2019s absurd to accuse you of abusing your children. The way you describe it you are very thoughtful about their needs \u2014 even giving up your bedroom so they can be together. I honestly think you\u2019re doing your kids a disservice if you separate them just to make your family happy. As the kids are ready for more privacy and independence I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll honor that. Set a boundary with your sister. This is truly ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYour kids are happy with it.

You aren\u2019t playing favourites, because you have rooms ready for when they do want the privacy of their own room. I\u2019d send out a group message to all the people harassing, tell exactly how things are, and anyone continuing to act like they know better will be promptly blocked on all platforms.", "I guess I see your sisters perspective because I could not dream of choosing to live that way BUT she needs to remember it\u2019s what works for your family. \n\nHowever, could you offer your other children there own room again now? They\u2019ll probably say no but at least that way you aren\u2019t \u2018favouring\u2019 one child over the others.", "NTA, mostly because it sounds like this situation developed from their preferences/habits and they can opt out of it when they desire. You\u2019re not forcing them; it sounds like something they want for now. \n\nBut even if that weren\u2019t the case\u2026being able have enough space to provide five kids with their own rooms is frankly a privilege. If I had five kids, I\u2019d expect 2-3 per bedroom with an oldest having their own room if anyone did. I certainly wouldn\u2019t judge anyone unable to provide each kid with their own room. Most houses just aren\u2019t built for it. It\u2019s certainly not abuse to share rooms; it\u2019s probably been the norm for far longer than the opposite. \n\nAnd honestly a benefit to your set up is if they mostly just sleep in the shared bedroom, you can use the other rooms for more concentrated purpose/activity spaces which also sounds pretty beneficial to the family as a whole. \n\nYour sister needs therapy and to mind her own business. It sounds like she\u2019s making a lot of assumptions and projecting her own insecurities. Did y\u2019all have to share a room as kids?", "NTA. I still cherish the memories from my childhood when with my cousins we would share a bedroom in the summer while staying at my grandparents (we were actually sharing a huge double bed, but were pre-teen at the time), telling stories before going to bed, sharing things, thoughts. It is a great bonding time. You sister has no clue about your children's relationship so don't let her narrow opinions affect you. A good idea might be to place a second single bed in your eldest daughter room though, since in 2 years probably the next sister will join her there and it might also allow \"sleepovers\" with her, if she feels like it ;)", "NTA I'm from a family of 6 kids.  We all shared a room at some point (but we also kinda had to). So long as your kids are happy with the arrangement there isn't a problem. It sounds like you'd be open to them having their own room if they expressed a need for it and will continue to give them their own rooms as they get older.  So no problems there.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to have your children share a bedroom, especially when they are young. You went above and beyond by creating a special space for your oldest daughter and keeping a daybed in the shared room for her sisters to use. It's clear that you're trying to balance your children's needs for privacy with their desires to be close to one another. Your sister's criticism seems unwarranted, especially since she's not the one raising five kids.  \nIt's also important to note that your children seem happy with the current arrangement. If they were unhappy sharing a room, that would be a different story. You've also made it clear that your children have other spaces in the house where they can be alone if they need to be.  \nIn short, don't let your sister's criticism get to you. You know your family's needs best, and you've made a thoughtful decision that works for everyone.", "NTA. What's up with your sister? Did you piss her off while you were growing up or something? Seems like she's going out of her way to hate you.", "NTA Your sister needs to mind her own business. If your kids are happy with the sleeping arrangements and it works for your family then why mess with it and worry about it just because your sister is butting in where she doesn't belong? Tell your sister your children are happy and how you and your husband raise them is up to you and your husband and not her. Tell her to go back to her lane and stay put.", "NTA. If your kids are okay with it, who cares? I had to share a large room with three sisters and both parents for a time (granted, we didn't really have a choice) and we survived just fine. Room sharing might be less common these days, but it isn't some terrible act of abuse if everyone's comfortable. So long as the kids can be open with you in the future if they want privacy, things seem fine as they are.", "NTA. My kids shared a room and enjoyed it. You know what works for your family. I think setting up a nice space for your oldest was a lovely idea. That way she can have some privacy as she gets into her teen years, when needed. And clearly she doesn't want to be too far, as she requested a spare bed in the original room. I think if your kids were fighting a lot and hated the arrangement, it might be different. But it sounds like you have a culture of closeness in your home. You're raising nice young humans.", "NTA. Your sister seems but*hurt. The bedroom dynamics will change as they grow (eventually boys and girls may be in different rooms, some may move out, granted in a few more years). My kids shared beds and bedrooms most of their childhood and they're happy with their settings. My eldest has their own room now and it works.\n\nWhat you do with your kids is your problem, not your whiny sister's. Don't worry about it.", "I'll say it's at 13 years old that teens need to have privacy. Before that, it's not really a problem, they are all the same sex, there is no tension (from what op said). Giving a personal room at 10 is quite a good method, I think.  \nNTA", "It was. My eldest was growing a little annoyed with all of the kids around her at night and when I noticed it, I sat the kids down and told them that having their own room was 100% a choice I would support their decision either way and it didn\u2019t mean that they loved their siblings less. That\u2019s when my daughter expressed that she didn\u2019t know if she was ready but wanted to try having her own room. That\u2019s why part of her birthday present was furniture and paint for the bedroom", "I think it\u2019s because my family grew up poor. Me and my sister were crammed into a really small room and didn\u2019t have the option of having our own space because of how small our house was(we literally joked that we lived in a dollhouse) I tried to explain that my kids chose this and I gave them multiple options to say no and still encourage them to speak up if they don\u2019t like the arrangement. However, even I had doubts because of my childhood so I\u2019m doubtful that I would be able to get through to her anytime soon", "My husband and I have a 5 bedroom house plus a finished basement that can be used as a room if needed. I originally planned to have my kids each have their own room but the rooms are split between two floors and when my kids started going into each others bedrooms at night I was afraid of one of them falling down the stairs because they would often bring their comforters with them. That\u2019s when I suggested giving all of them the master bedroom until they were ready to be on their own or at least old enough that I don\u2019t worry as much when they are traveling up and down the stairs at night.", "When I noticed my oldest was growing and showing a need for privacy, I didn\u2019t want to single her out so I sat all of the kids down for a family meeting and encouraged them to tell me if they needed more space and I would gladly do that. That\u2019s when my oldest spoke up and the rest looked at me like I was crazy lol so I guess they\u2019re not ready just yet", "Thank you! I always try to remind my kids to be grateful of the position we\u2019re in. My family grew up poor and crammed together in a very tiny house. I worked hard and went through a lot of therapy to make sure I could give my family a better life then I had. I\u2019m sure my sister still hold some resentment to how we grew up", "Then double N T A from me, you are giving the kids agency and choice, im sure many many people who had to share with siblings would have loved the choice.", "It sounds like you\u2019re doing great for your kids \u2014 considering their preferences and adjusting as you go along. I honestly think your girls will have great memories of sharing that bedroom and are probably closer as a result.", "OMG, this one is so fucking simple to figure out.  ASK YOUR FUCKING KIDS HOW THEY WANT IT.  If the kids want to be in 1 room, then no issue.  If they want their own rooms, then do it.  If some want to share and others want their own rooms, then split up those that want it.\n\nThis way, your not forcing anything on anyone.  Then your sister can go fuck herself because it was determined by the kids themselves.", "Okay I have no other suggestions the haha!", "Sounds like that's exactly what OP did but the sister still somehow has a problem with it"]}
