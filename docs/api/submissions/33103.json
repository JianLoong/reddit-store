I love her but she was annoying about the whole thing a lot of the time and it was almost her entire personality at one point. She hated rich people to the point that when she met her husband she claimed he only wanted to date her because he wasn\u2019t used to not getting his way because he grew up rich and she\u2019d get angry whenever he did anything nice for her. Even when she married him she claimed it was okay because she could give all of his money away if she did.\n\nThey moved to Australia a few months ago and they were supposed to stay there for 3 years minimum but my cousin found out she was pregnant 2 weeks ago and according to her husband had a complete meltdown. She\u2019s never lived away from her parents before and she said she was already overwhelmed because her life has been changing so fast so finding out she was pregnant was the final straw. Her husband is really sweet so he dropped everything and they left Australia the very next day.\n\nHe has to go back after the holidays to sort some things out and it seems like they\u2019re going to have to be long distance for a while since my cousin doesn\u2019t want to be so far from family. She told me he was planning to fly back and forth while he sorted some things out. I pointed out how that would be really bad for the environment since she still acts like she\u2019s super passionate about climate change. She claims they don\u2019t have another choice which I pointed out is very clearly a lie. I also told her she had become a hypocrite by marrying her husband since he was everything she stood against personified. I think her pregnancy hormones got to her because she started crying when she normally wouldn\u2019t cry over something like this.\n\nI feel bad for making her cry since that wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702686383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jen05/aita_for_calling_my_cousin_a_hypocrite_for/", "score": 2140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mad props to her for playing the system.", "YTA, it wasn\u2019t pregnancy hormones, you were just mean. One thing we learn in life is never say never because life has a twisted humour. As people grow their views and opinions change, and that\u2019s totally okay. It was a fair comment about the environment because that is true, but is he taking a private jet? If not and if he\u2019s flying on commercial planes then it really doesn\u2019t have a big environmental impact anyway. Also she\u2019s clearly going through something, so maybe bring this up \u201cjokingly\u201d at a later date, not seriously when she\u2019s have life crisis", "How old are you OP? I hope you are young and naive, and not just a petty excuse of a grown up. YTA", "YTA.  At the end of the day she\u2019s going through a stressful situation and you didn\u2019t need to call her out right now.  Is she a hypocrite?  Maybe or maybe she\u2019s changed her opinions on things over time.  Her ranting may have been a bit annoying but it never hurt you and this wasn\u2019t what she needs to hear right now.", "A good amount of people don't hate \"rich people\".. they hate billionaires.. millionaires aren't the enemy.", "YTA. Unless she married Jeff Bezos or a Walton, I\u2019m not seeing an issue. Rich is one thing, but the wealthy are who truly drive the capitalist system.", "YTA. Life changes. People change. You have to allow room for circumstances in life to change.\n\nShe has changed. You have not. \n\nThis was not about pregnancy hormones. This was about you belittling and deriding your cousin for absolutely no reason other than you wanted to take shots at her.", "YTA. She can have a problem with wasteful rich people and still love her husband. Perhaps he's a good guy and not spoiled or entitled or wasteful. You sound jealous.", "YTA, but you\u2019re an even bigger asshole depending on how rich this guy is. \u201cEat the rich\u201d is referencing destroying billionaires/redistributing wealth of the mega rich. How rich is this dude? Does he own corporations that exploit others? \n\nLefties are talking about destroying the top 1%, the people who have more money than they could ever spend in a lifetime.", "Info: how rich is he?\n\nLike, does he earn $500k+ per year? Or is he a billionaire?\n\nBecause when people say \"eat the rich\" we don't mean wealthy. We mean grotesquely rich. People who have more wealth than some small country's GDP. Most people believe (and I'm amongst them) billionaires should not exist. Because _they're_ the ones who are hoarding all of the resources, not the merely wealthy. Being able to drop a few thousand dollars on an international emergency flight is not rich. To you and me, maybe, but in the grand scheme of things, they're not rich. Hell, earning $500k+ a year might get you in the top 5% in Australia, but the wealthiest person in Australia is Gina Reinhardt, who owns a whopping $37.41 billion. Guess why she's rich? Because she's a heiress to a mining mogul.\n\nAlso, flying around the world is barely a drop in the bucket for climate change. The top 100 polluting companies produce 70% of the carbon dioxide. Placing the onus on the everyday person to reduce our carbon outputs was a very successful PR campaign for companies like Exxon and Amazon. No matter what individuals do, we will never come close to off setting the pollution that mega corporations release. The argument of \"well, if the world just reduced our consumption\" is bollocks, too, because these companies would find a way to make it so line goes up, no matter how much we as individuals do to reduce our pollution.\n\nDid you know Space X's flight released 116 tonnes of CO2 in 165 seconds? Do you genuinely believe your cousin jumping on a plane that was ALREADY GOING TO BE IN THE AIR was going to release even anything CLOSE to that?\n\nSo yeah, YTA.", "What was your intention?", "YTA.

Nothing worse than the holier than thou attitude when they\u2019re acting like social justice warriors. Then they do something like this. Did she marry him because of the money?", "YTA. If you pointed out the carbon footprint of her husband\u2019s flights while she was ranting about rich people ruining the environment, that would be one thing. But you did it in response to her venting about being overwhelmed by an unplanned pregnancy and being separated from her husband. You jumped at an opportunity knock down a struggling family member simply because they have been annoying in the past, thinking you are justified in this grand \u201cgotchya\u201d moment. That\u2019s not calling out a hypocrite, that\u2019s just being cruel.", "Did it need to be said  \nDid it need to be said right now  \nDid it need to be said right now by you.  \n\n\n1st is a yes, 2nd and 3rd are a no.  This makes YTA.", "But didn't you mean to hurt her feelings? Why else even bring it up? People change. She has every right to be who she wants to be whenever she chooses to be that person. Stop being jealous and let her have her life.", "Yta. Why even say it? At this moment? Her life is clearly hard for her. Sometimes we get faced with our demons and it's up to the people who love us to give us support and walk us through those times.", "YTA. You sound pretty jealous of her life. Sounds like she can\u2019t win with you, huh?", "Life shrinks when your own is in session. Global concerns do not match personal ones when a crisis or even a medical condition presents for LOTS of people. Is it hypocritical to care more about your needs than the needs of the planet? I'm not sure. It hardly matters though. Your cousin gets to decide this regardless of what you think of her. YTA.\n\nHer pregnancy and her carbon footprint aren't equally prioritized right now. That's her truth - even of you would behave differently in her shoes.", "Nta, if she was a judgey know it all and now all of a sudden there\u2019s a grey area where she is concerned I would be like WTF.  she was black and white before but now that she would have to make sacrifices it\u2019s different. I would also want to point it out. Would I point it out to a pregnant lady, maybe not, I would just distance myself from someone like that but I can\u2019t fault you for saying something. \n Her morals changed really quick when it comes to herself. \n\nIf you have to keep a relationship. I would only clap back and bring up the hypocrisy if she ever starts going on about climate change and the rich ruining the world. She\u2019s part of the problem, you get the money and you stop doing the right thing because money is comfortability.", "Yta that wasn't her crying bc of pregnancy hormones. You were just plain mean.", "Rules for thee, not for me.", "NTA you gave her a taste of her own medicine and her judgmental ass didnt like it. She is the rich she hates now Who has the luxury of just flying back and forth all because she had a tantrum about being pregnant away from family. She is a complete hypocrite.", "But hear me out, MAYBE she actually loves him for who he is and MAYBE he loves that she keeps him somewhat grounded and maybe adds perspective to his life and maybe they might actually be compatible partners? \n\nIrony is proof the Gods have a sense of humor. Laugh a little.", "YTA you had that locked and loaded for a while and kicked her while she was down", "YTA. You sound jealous.", "YTA. One, eat the rich is about institutional wealth , not rich people. Two, if he has to work in Australia , there isn't an option.", "Yta, your sister was never wrong, good on her for making one be useful and spread some of that wealth around", "YTA", "Yta. You seem jealous. People are allowed to change their opinions.", "YTA \n\nMYOFB", "YTA, there is a time and place for such ideological talk. And it wasn\u2019t that.", "Nta, must be nice to not be able to follow your convictions through out life. And to the others saying life changes etc etc. If she had truly believed what she was preaching she wouldn't have dated the rich guy. But because she wanted money she got the rich guy.", "Sorry to say, but YTA. People are allowed to change. A younger person's rigid ideas will almost always need adjustment as they gain more life experience--especially something as broad and vague as \"all rich people are bad.\" \n\nWhile her previous strident attitudes might have been annoying, and it may be tempting to rub her face in it... people shouldn't be punished for growing up. \n\nIn addition, this sounds like a tough time. She's pregnant, has had to choose between being separated from home and family or her husband. The long distance travel and pregnancy is no doubt putting stress on the relationship. And no doubt the air travel back and forth bothers her--for a lot of reasons. A little more compassion and less smugness is in order.", "Lol NTA, my bf is kinda like that. Loves waxing poetic against privilege, but once we started dating (I make 10x what he does) he had no problem at all moving rent-free to the city's nicest neighborhood where I live, Ubering everywhere and never having to cook or clean (in fact sometimes I wash myself the dishes he leaves for the housekeepers because I'm embarrassed of them seeing that much of a mess). Several of his friends have called him out on it even, and to be clear on paper he still holds the same views \u2013 just like OP said about the cousin, he just finds clever ways to make himself an exception.\n\nAnd to those here saying people are allowed to change, of course they are but there's a difference between maturing and being a hypocrite. It's one thing to change your views as you mature and better understand the world, it's another to change them just because they became inconvenient to your own circumstances.", "NTA. All of these \"people change as they grow\" commentators should look at when she changed. She did not change gradually as she got older. She changed her opinion once she got money. She's a hypocrite.", "NTA she would bitch someone else out for doing the exact same thing but with her \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have any other option\u201d when the option of living lavishly in Australia is absolutely an option.", "It\u2019s hard out there, good for her", "NTA. Practice what you preach", "YTA.  I'm not sure why you decided THIS was the time to say any of this to her or what you were hoping to gain from it. I AM curious whether he's taking a private jet or is just going to be on a regular flight, because there's a MAJOR difference in environmental impact there.", "YTA. I mean, when is it ever a good idea to start picking apart a person's flaws ESPECIALLY when they're pregnant? And then her husband is across the globe and they're going through a stressful time. Hormones or not, you weren't being kind at all. Like, you can not like a person and still be civil towards them. What was your intention if it wasn't to be mean to her? You're calling the kettle black if you want to talk about hypocrisy. \n\nAnd people can change. Does this make her a hypocrite? Sure. But take this as personal growth that she's relaxing her more \"annoying\" aspects. Yes, it's obviously because she's benefitting from being well-off, but frankly, I know few people who wouldn't also hop on that well-off train to a better life. \n\nTry supporting her instead of being a jerk about it. I hope you apologized and you should find a way to meaningfully make it up to her.", "Nta, she clearly was just running her mouth about being anti rich and worried about the climate until she got an opportunity to be rich. You just pointed out the obvious.", "YTA. People evolve as they learn and grow. Your sister was ignorant and sanctimonious when she was younger. She's learning that things aren't always black and white. Good for her. Now you need to grow up. You can start by doing some digging into the \"climate change\" problem. Really look at the science. Look at dissenting viewpoints. Broaden your mind about that topic, then tackle another. It's extremely liberating to get out from under propaganda and lies.", "Yta and you know Yta. Choosing to marry someone with money doesn\u2019t negate that she has the feelings she has about people being rich. You also may have different ideas of what counts as rich. Either way you intentionally tried to hurt her feelings.", "YTA.  Not your intention?  I doubt that.", "NTA. She sounds insufferable, and deserves to be taken down a notch. Maybe she will learn to have a more nuanced view of the world now and stop being so hateful.", "Sounds like you're a little jelly there OP", "Yes you are the AH . She had one or you believe she only had one idea but found prince charming who Is doing everything that a loving husband is supposed to do. \n\nLet her live her new life and do apologize. She's allowed to be happy", "YTA. You sound ignorant.", "YTA but also saying they do have another choice would be... her husband not flying ever again to see his pregnant wife?", "People really need to stop using pregnancy as an excuse for being an asshole. Despite what people like to think, it's not a disability.\n\nNTA. Your cousin is a hypocrite and she doesn't even have the shame to admit it.", "YTA.

Wtf do you expect them to do, sailboat? She's pregnant you asshole. He wants to be there for your cousin and his baby. You're pretty much an awful person who has their priorities severely out of wack.\n\n>told her she had become a hypocrite\n\nYou're the hypocrite, pretending to care about family while being blatantly rude and disrespectful to her current circumstances because she isn't fitting into all the little boxes you think she should.

You're a jerk, and honestly - I think you're jealous.\n\n> I think her pregnancy hormones got to her because she started crying when she normally wouldn\u2019t cry over something like this.\n\nShe was crying because you're an uncaring, hurtful, disrespectful Asshole.

They're both fabulously wealthy, have no jobs, and do whatever the fuck they want....  And guess who's not complaining about the rich anymore. Weird how that works.", "NTA.

I love her but she was annoying about the whole thing a lot of the time and it was almost her entire personality at one point. She hated rich people to the point that when she met her husband she claimed he only wanted to date her because he wasn\u2019t used to not getting his way because he grew up rich and she\u2019d get angry whenever he did anything nice for her. Even when she married him she claimed it was okay because she could give all of his money away if she did.\n\nThey moved to Australia a few months ago and they were supposed to stay there for 3 years minimum but my cousin found out she was pregnant 2 weeks ago and according to her husband had a complete meltdown. She\u2019s never lived away from her parents before and she said she was already overwhelmed because her life has been changing so fast so finding out she was pregnant was the final straw. Her husband is really sweet so he dropped everything and they left Australia the very next day.\n\nHe has to go back after the holidays to sort some things out and it seems like they\u2019re going to have to be long distance for a while since my cousin doesn\u2019t want to be so far from family. She told me he was planning to fly back and forth while he sorted some things out. I pointed out how that would be really bad for the environment since she still acts like she\u2019s super passionate about climate change. She claims they don\u2019t have another choice which I pointed out is very clearly a lie. I also told her she had become a hypocrite by marrying her husband since he was everything she stood against personified. I think her pregnancy hormones got to her because she started crying when she normally wouldn\u2019t cry over something like this.\n\nI feel bad for making her cry since that wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sounds like you don't understand social or emotional nuances at all. There's a difference between being mean and being mean-spirited, and there's also a difference between being mean and being rude. Calling someone ugly is mean. Asking someone \"do you *really* think you're going to win a beauty pageant\" isn't technically mean in its words, but it's mean-spirited. Similarly, someone can be rude just by saying something in the wrong setting even if it wouldn't be rude in a different setting, like saying \"holy cow it smells horrible in here\" when you walk into a barn vs when you walk into someone's house. Going back to the word itself, while you're technically right that the word \"hypocrite\" isn't mean, it **is** undeniably harsh, aggressive, and a criticism as you yourself stated. In other words, it's an attack against the person. Regardless of whether it's urgent or necessary it's undoubtedly something intended to tear down.\n\nIn addition to being openly mean-spirited and rude, OP also specifically sought out an opportunity to take this shot. The fact that frequent flights was briefly mentioned was not a natural Segway any more than someone talking about their cucumber eye mask during a story about their spa day is a natural Segway into suddenly switching the conversation to Veggie Tales. When comes to you seeking to vent and find support about their presently overwhelming emotional struggles, it is almost universally considered inappropriate to bring up criticism entirely unrelated to their situation.\n\nTo summarize, OP immediately jumped on an opportunity to steer the conversation in the direction of tearing down their cousin, who had specifically come to them for emotional support during what is almost certainly the most overwhelming and emotionally difficult situation she has ever found herself in. OP made it clear they were fully aware of the cousin's situation and struggles, then decided their first response to this emotional venting should be \"frequent flying is bad for the environment and a waste of money, you're a hypocrite and your current lifestyle goes against everything you claim to believe.\" In what world would that be considered either on topic or appropriate?\n\nTo compare, imagine your grandpa dies, and you hold an expensive funeral for him. You call a friend to tell them about how hard his loss has been and mention the expensive funeral. Your friend simply responds with \"aren't you the one who's always talked about how capitalism is infecting every aspect of life and we shouldn't be spending money on things that aren't necessary? Funerals are a waste of money, how does it feel to be a hypocrite?\" How would you feel when the friend you reached out to for support is instead berating you for something comparatively trivial and entirely beside the point?\n\nAs for your point about criticism, it's funny you mention that because I actually actively seek criticism. I'm extremely improvement-oriented to a degree that irritates a lot of people and I'm always asking others to tell me if there's anything they think I could stand to improve with my cooking, or manners, or work-related skills, etc. This is not about taking criticism, this is not about whether or not OPs cousin is a hypocrite, this is not about airplanes being bad for the environment, and it's not about the evils of wealth.
