Does your roommate stand outside the bathroom door and comment on the sounds you make whilst relieving yourself? \n\nLiving with roommates requires compromise but this is asking too much. If your other roommates are in agreement that you are not being unduly loud then it is your one roommate who is the issue.

With the TV that loud, you know exactly what they're doing, even if you don't hear the specific act.\n\nI once shot an eraser at my mom's door with a slingshot when they did this, and they screamed and her girlfriend went home crying. I was probably TA for that, but point is: mind your noise.", "Info - does your bf sleep over every night? Is he on the lease or paying some of the rent? That may be more of the issue that she simply doesn't want a 4rth roommate or someone that using the utilities for free.

I would run a couple of tests where you do what you normally do but not have sex or even undress.

It's courteous, that's all it is. If someone says \"hey please keep the noise down\" that's a polite signal that you're being disruptive and they're letting you know that. Being indignant about it is going to just cause issues in your living situation, the people you live with are super important to keep the peace with IMO, and if the differences are so bad you can't navigate it without creating friction y'all gotta part ways and move ASAP. \n\nI had a situation like this in college: 4 man house, all of us had girlfriends we were sexually active with. We all only ever heard 1 roommate, because him and his gf would bang like it was WWE Smackdown. I could hear the springs in his bed cry out in pain, I could hear every syllable in his girlfriends OH MY GOD FUUUUUCK MEEEEEEE from down in the basement. I know the cadence that his balls slap the backsides of her thighs. It was just way too much to know about the act, if I heard a little bit, just like \"oh damn he's in there getting laid good work bud\" it was no big thang and easily ignorable, but it was the fact it was a concert that we had no choice but to participate in that created the problem. \n\nWe told him about this, he apologized, didn't realize it was that bad, made changes. He was a big dude so we would still hear things every so often, but that was fine and kinda expected, everybody got a pass. \n\nTake this advice as you may OP, at the core of it I just really don't want what should be a minor and easily resolved conflict turn into a bigger one between roommates.

She can feel free to be a virgin and a lesbian and all the other stuff she feels like being, in her room alone.

This sounds like an extreme invasion of privacy here, and you have a right to do whatever you want with your boyfriend in your own room. Plus, you seem to have already taken every reasonable consideration to respect your roommates' space. Through from your context post, you should probably declare a measured house meeting with all your roommates to discuss this situation and lay down ground rules for *all* guests or this is really going to fester. If she is really not comfortable with a man in the apartment, you should discuss this and maybe come to compromise. She could make ask for advanced notice for when your bf comes over, but also you have the right to have your boyfriend over occasionally. Also, you really need to get an explanation for how she knows when you are having sex. And you should make it clear what problems you have with *her* group of friends. If you cannot get her to move the gathering elsewhere, you need to enforce boundaries with noise level, cleanliness, and what times they can be there. I find it hard to believe your other roommates do not have opinions on these situations. If you all cannot have come to a reasonable agreement, either you should consider moving out or asking her to do so. Take it from my own personal experiences with a roommate having loud D&D gatherings at all hours and not cleaning up afterward, and another experience with a roommate who would have boys over all the time and make no effort to muffle the noise, communicating your grievances now can save a lot of headache in the future and make sure both of you are happy with your living situations.", "NTA but adults do that regularly?

She needs to grow the hell up and learn how to leave people alone.", "So how does she interact with males in an education / work / social / crowded atmosphere?\nOr is her head stuck so far up her p@#$y she doesn't know day from night?", "That would make me wonder if she has some SA in her past that she hasn\u2019t dealt with. Which while that is hard, it is also still something she has to choose to work through to function in society. (And I\u2019m speaking as someone who knows this struggle firsthand.)\nAnd not being in a relationship and saying she is lesbian, it may be how she protects herself.\nBut this is all very much speculation that may be crossing the boundaries on my part.\n\nAlso my first thought is that you turning the tv and fan on are what are clueing her in to your activities. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My logic was if it were me I\u2019d rather hear a loud tv and fan than actual sex noises lol.", "He stays in my room most of the time and keeps to himself if he is here. I personally don\u2019t see an issue with three nights a week if someone else were to have someone over. Especially with how much he contributes but that\u2019s just me.", "No?", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s camping I think she hears my door shut or my tv turn up and then assumes and then comes to the door and listens to confirm. Last time she knocked and bitched me out we were barely kissing, clothes hadn\u2019t even come off yet. Like how did you even know", "It\u2019s crazy cuz the last time she knocked and got mad at me for \u201cbeing too loud\u201d we weren\u2019t even doing anything except kissing and watching a movie", "The rule per the lease is \u201cno more than three consecutive nights\u201d we follow that. He does shower here sometimes and use our kitchen but, our energy, water, heat etc are a flat rate included in rent so he is not costing us more money by spending time here. He frequently buys groceries for our apartment and cooks what he likes to call \u201cfamily dinners\u201d for my roommates and I. He cleans up after himself as well as does my roommates dishes for them and takes the trash out out of kindness. We keep to ourselves mostly and stay in my room unless we are in the living room socializing with my roommates which is rare. He is not a burden here nor should his presence cause issues with my roomies considering we arnet breaking any rules, he does a lot of things for them, and he is quiet and considerate of the fact that this apartment is not his space. I don\u2019t think her efforts to stop us from having sex are caused by an underlying issue of him overstaying his welcome or being a nuisance. I think she just has an issue with sex.", "I would put headphones on or something. I don't control my mother and if she wants to get busy that's her prerogative.", "Than this roomie should live alone and stop being a prude c.", "I was gna say, is being uncomfortable around men a common trait for lesbians ?", "I reached out and was like I understand your feelings on the subject and am sorry it makes you uncomfy but idk what else I could to do accommodate you. Also I really hope there are no terms in the lease like that, I live in Utah so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I\u2019ll have to check", "Happy Cake day!", "What in the hell is a cishet interloper ?? Lol", "Yeah I agree that it\u2019s harassment!", "Our apartment management doesn\u2019t allow guests to stay over night longer than three consecutive days so no more than that.", "I understand. In my paranoid state I would appreciate it if shown I was cared about, I guess. Maybe have a private conversation with her about all this talking about it head on. The \u2018I am not comfortable around being other men\u2019 thing (you wrote they identify as trans?) I would ignore, unless she has had a history of sexual abuse", "I\u2019ve never seen a lease written in such a way that allows a guest to stay over three nights a week every week, but I\u2019ll take your word for it.", "Id get a camera put right outside your door. She should stop assuming and honestly mind her own business, or she can find somewhere else to live.", "Unless the other roomies have a problem too, she's just crazy. Make sure they arent hearing you too. If not, then get REALLY LOUD whenever she talks to you. Say GOOD MORNING, pretend to talk on your phone, just warn the roomies first.", "On the other hand, if you can hear it all throughout the house, that\u2019s a problem. My roommate and his boyfriend are loud every weekend. One time me and my other roommates were having a game night with some friends, and they started going at it super loud right above us. Totally rude and made everyone uncomfortable. \n\nOP sounds like she is making a great effort to be quiet and considerate, which is more than can be said about a lot of people\u2026 NTA", "Most people probably slept in a room near where their mom was having sex \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nLet\u2019s be real. \ud83d\ude02", "Many of my best friends are straight dudes. \ud83c\udf7b", "Some of my best friends and roommates was a lesbian couple. Man listen, when I tell you you can learn some shit, you can learn some shit.", "There\u2019s a Three\u2019s Company joke here, I know it. \ud83e\udd23", "I believe her orientation is \"questioning\".\n\nOr possibly \"throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.\"", "Your room mate is the fake trans confused people the republicans have been searching for.", "Your roommate sounds like a quack, tell her to up her dosage.", "Nooooo.", "Maybe he should just leave her alone if she doesn't appreciate his kindness", "Sheesh, I really hope not too! Never lived in Utah so I\u2019m not familiar with what a typical lease is like there, but did  do a solo car camping and hiking trip through southern Utah and, based on that experience, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised either. Fingers crossed for you.", "Thank you!!", "Cishet is shorthand for cisgender and heterosexual, an interloper is someone who involves themself where they\u2019re unwanted.", "It doesn\u2019t specify \u201cevery week\u201d it says \u201cno more than three nights in a week\u201d", "Of course not, only fools stay ignorant. Congrats", "This is Reddit. Please fix your grammar.", "Bro doesn\u2019t know that a straw man argument is a logical fallacy and automatically disqualifies the person employing it from having a leg to stand on.

Hopefully she\u2019s willing to communicate through this with you", "It's just none of their business, what is going on in your room.", "Which is a perfectly valid thing to do honestly!!! As long as you try not to make it anyone else\u2019s problem beside your therapist.", "All OP did was say that it confuses her, which is pretty fair because this is genuinely unusual and you know that, there really isnt anything invalidating about that, this lecture was so unnecessary, signed, a trans person", "Lesbians have male friends too. She needs to go to therapy to work through her anti-man issues or live alone.", "Or she should have mentioned this before signing the lease as opposed to not saying anything until AFTER moving in.", "The comment I replied to says \u201c\u2026three nights a week\u201d, and completely suggests your lease restricts you to three nights a week.", "I did send her a text and she denies to listening in to my room and what not and said she\u2019d like to discuss things more but honestly at this point I feel I owe her nothing. It\u2019s starting to just piss me off lol", "You know, throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks is pretty much the default for people developing their own identities.\n\nSadly--and like so many of us, myself included--being obnoxious about it is also an unfortunate byproduct of the process until one of the things that sticks is \"maturity\".", "You didnt do anything invalidating you just said it confuses you because\u2026 it is confusing. I\u2019m trans and have spent a lot of time talking to people early in the discovery process and this is genuinely unusual. Not unheard of, but far far from common. Personally, her lack of doing any actual transitioning is totally whatever, these things are very difficult, but throwing out her trans and gay identities to try to guilt you makes me see fuckin red. Honestly, how dare she", "Yes, in fact it is very much not trans but hey these are the days where anyone can say anything believe anything and everyone else must accept that truth\u2026whatever it is\u2026as truth. Clearly we are in very fucked times", "Not all lesbians have male friends. I know several who are against me and probably also need therapy", "She probably isn't hearing you have sex but hears the TV and fan and knows that's the coverup to you two having sex. I personally would turn on the tv and fan and sit by the door waiting for her to knock and when she does swing it wide open and ask her what she needs\ud83d\ude06", "Turn on the fan and TV and leave the room for a bit, hang in the kitchen or smth and see if she comes a bangin on your door", "I\u2019m trying to think of a nice way for you to say \u201chey you need to talk to a therapist about this,\u201d because I felt this EXACT way about my roommates\u2019 male sleepover buddies when I was in college (freaked out like your roommate is exactly twice I think), and it wasn\u2019t until years later that I figured out my reaction was a trauma response to something that had happened when I was younger. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re doing anything wrong, OP, and I think your roommate will be happier and healthy if she takes this as a cue to figure her baggage out. Sorry you\u2019re all dealing with this :(", "Oh yeah, heavy emphasis on TRY not to make it anyone elses problem lol.
