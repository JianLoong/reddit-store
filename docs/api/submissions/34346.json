Does your roommate stand outside the bathroom door and comment on the sounds you make whilst relieving yourself? \n\nLiving with roommates requires compromise but this is asking too much. If your other roommates are in agreement that you are not being unduly loud then it is your one roommate who is the issue.

With the TV that loud, you know exactly what they're doing, even if you don't hear the specific act.\n\nI once shot an eraser at my mom's door with a slingshot when they did this, and they screamed and her girlfriend went home crying. I was probably TA for that, but point is: mind your noise.", "Info - does your bf sleep over every night? Is he on the lease or paying some of the rent? That may be more of the issue that she simply doesn't want a 4rth roommate or someone that using the utilities for free.

I would run a couple of tests where you do what you normally do but not have sex or even undress.

It's courteous, that's all it is. If someone says \"hey please keep the noise down\" that's a polite signal that you're being disruptive and they're letting you know that. Being indignant about it is going to just cause issues in your living situation, the people you live with are super important to keep the peace with IMO, and if the differences are so bad you can't navigate it without creating friction y'all gotta part ways and move ASAP. \n\nI had a situation like this in college: 4 man house, all of us had girlfriends we were sexually active with. We all only ever heard 1 roommate, because him and his gf would bang like it was WWE Smackdown. I could hear the springs in his bed cry out in pain, I could hear every syllable in his girlfriends OH MY GOD FUUUUUCK MEEEEEEE from down in the basement. I know the cadence that his balls slap the backsides of her thighs. It was just way too much to know about the act, if I heard a little bit, just like \"oh damn he's in there getting laid good work bud\" it was no big thang and easily ignorable, but it was the fact it was a concert that we had no choice but to participate in that created the problem. \n\nWe told him about this, he apologized, didn't realize it was that bad, made changes. He was a big dude so we would still hear things every so often, but that was fine and kinda expected, everybody got a pass. \n\nTake this advice as you may OP, at the core of it I just really don't want what should be a minor and easily resolved conflict turn into a bigger one between roommates.

She can feel free to be a virgin and a lesbian and all the other stuff she feels like being, in her room alone.

This sounds like an extreme invasion of privacy here, and you have a right to do whatever you want with your boyfriend in your own room. Plus, you seem to have already taken every reasonable consideration to respect your roommates' space. Through from your context post, you should probably declare a measured house meeting with all your roommates to discuss this situation and lay down ground rules for *all* guests or this is really going to fester. If she is really not comfortable with a man in the apartment, you should discuss this and maybe come to compromise. She could make ask for advanced notice for when your bf comes over, but also you have the right to have your boyfriend over occasionally. Also, you really need to get an explanation for how she knows when you are having sex. And you should make it clear what problems you have with *her* group of friends. If you cannot get her to move the gathering elsewhere, you need to enforce boundaries with noise level, cleanliness, and what times they can be there. I find it hard to believe your other roommates do not have opinions on these situations. If you all cannot have come to a reasonable agreement, either you should consider moving out or asking her to do so. Take it from my own personal experiences with a roommate having loud D&D gatherings at all hours and not cleaning up afterward, and another experience with a roommate who would have boys over all the time and make no effort to muffle the noise, communicating your grievances now can save a lot of headache in the future and make sure both of you are happy with your living situations.", "NTA but adults do that regularly?

They\u2019re not harming you and they\u2019re entitled to have sex in their own room with the door shut. That is an adult choice they get to make.\n\nIf your skin positively crawls at the notion of another adult having sex under your shared roof, don\u2019t live with roommates. It\u2019s not for everyone! Some people just can\u2019t tolerate it. That\u2019s fine, as long as you recognize that it\u2019s a you-problem, and it requires a you-solution.", "If you need to make up a ridiculous scenario that'll never happen to prove your point, you never had a point in the first place.", "It\u2019s semi ridiculous because my boyfriend has made extra advances to make her comfortable knowing she has issues with guys. He chats with her in kitchen and asks her how her day was, is always kind and gentle, makes us all dinner occasionally and even goes so far as to clean our kitchen and take out the trash for us.", "Preach. I'm a straight guy and I ended up with two lesbian room mates in my early 20s, both of them were amazing people, never had any issues with both of them. They never had any issues with my girlfriend at the time and none of their girlfriends ever had any issue with me either.", "She confuses me because she identifies as trans but \u201cfem presenting\u201d but her pronouns are also feminine and she\u2019s also a lesbian so I don\u2019t understand how you can say ur trans female to male when you are a bio female who is feminine presenting that uses feminine pronouns. And she also takes no steps to actually transition. My little brother is trans and this whole situation is just so different from when he came out.", "Could be she doesn\u2019t want to have feelings for him but he\u2019s actually being nice to her and she\u2019s never had that\u2026?", "This is a brilliant comment lol. I would love to see the roommate try and counter that one.", "If she really actually hears it it's so much worse because then you'll feel like shit (you already do, otherwise you wouldn't be here asking if you're the AH or not) and there's literally nothing else you can do... I hope all turns out well in the end with no grudge held.", "Ooh! Good idea.", "My folks send us to our cousins. \n\nSo for you==When your \"uncles\" wanted play time with your mom. Where did they send you?", "I'm seeing a few people suggest you try repeating the TV/fan bit, without anything else, to see if she still pesters you. You might as well rule it out!", "Stranger things have happened. Have you lived there long ?  When her dnd people come over is it mixed sexes ? Has she done this stuff to your other flat mates? I'd ask her, either I'm right and you talk it through,  or I'm not and she potentially gets embarrassed and leaves you alone. Win win", "Ahhh I would not want to be a lesbian in Happy Valley. Is she mo? It could be a sex thing in general and not just about your guy. Sexual hangups aren't limited to the straights", "That\u2019s a tough one. Most people have the good sense to develop selective hearing. There were certainly nights when I pulled my pillow over my head to block out the sounds of activities on the other side of the wall. It\u2019s just part of the college experience. The good news is you are halfway through the year.\n\nI was really incredibly lucky to have great roomies when I was in school but many friends did not. Good roommates are worth their weight in gold! The others are to be endured.", "Yeah if her problem is imagining sex sounds and that bothers her, that's her problem. If your TV volume was the issue, then she'd need to say that. Like I said, NTA", "Maybe you should shut your door, turn on the TV, and wait to see if she knocks. If so, open the door to show you were not having sex at all, and ask why she is lurking outside your door.", "It would help the roommate know if the creepy roommate is listening at her door for activity.  Or based on closing the door and having the fan/tv on - knocks that something is happening.", "Based on the question it seems relevant to how the roommate knows what OP is doing in her bedroom with her boyfriend. \n\nSince the roommate seems to always know when they're doing the deed, it seems like she is either listening outside their door at all times (seeing as they are sometimes in OP's bedroom with the door closed and NOT doing the deed). \n\nWhich makes the roommate pretty weird, to be honest with you.", "I think I realized that in reading some comments but it is almost exactly like a post from a couple months ago. So weird. These roommates might just be lonely or jealous or just weird.", "Something's up with her. Your other roomies don't hear you so she's either jealous or thinking, \"If I'm not getting any, nobody is.\" If she was truly scared of your boyfriend she wouldn't knock on your door.", "Look as someone who is Queer As FK my comment is totally valid. The roommates room is 2 rooms down. No one else hears OP having sex but the roomie who is so uncomfortable is lurking by her door to hear if she\u2019s having sex? Nah it\u2019s a little sus..", "None in the house period is a non-starter, full stop lmfao. \n\nInteresting situation, like I said courtesy is the name of the game with roommates and it would suck to escalate the situation any further. Good luck bud.", "I was joking. She's jealous, I think. Sounds like a shitty situation. Your BF sounds like a great bloke. Good luck.", "I\u2019m not readin allat", "Bro doesn\u2019t know what a straw man argument is", "She should live either other lesbiams if she's uncomfortable around men", "Maybe she likes you and can't stand the thought of you having sex with your boyfriend lol", "Trans is a broad spectrum. Gender is more than a binary. Not all trans people are the same. \nYour roommate is being an asshole but that does not give you the right to question or invalidate her chosen identity.", "Roommate is a lesbian bruh, they were talking about the roommate having feelings for OP/being jealous of the boyfriend", "I\u2019m thinking of shooting her a text being like \u201chey I know so and so makes you uncomfy and I\u2019m sorry for that but I am at a loss in this situation and am now feeling like my privacy is being invaded etc\u2026 if you have any suggestions on how we can relieve the tension I am open but asking me to not engage in sex in the privacy of my own room is unrealistic\u2026 etc\u201d", "She is ex Mo as are all my other roomies. But she is the only one uncomfy about me and my boyfriend engaging. My other two roommates also identify as bi/lesbian and they do not care that I prefer men. I don\u2019t want to assume that it\u2019s a sexuality issue but I really hope it isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t want to offend.", "The OP said he cooks for all her roomates", "Ur good lol thanks!", "I\u2019ll abbreviate. You\u2019re wrong. You don\u2019t get to control what others do in a closed room. Regardless of how you feel \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Thanks for sharing?", "I\u2019m not readin allat", "I really don\u2019t think that is the case lol. But I sure hope not", "I\u2019m not at all!! I don\u2019t mind either way I just don\u2019t understand any of it. I thought trans was someone who is actively transitioning or identifies with a different gender other than the one they were assigned at birth. Like I said my little brother is trans and actively on T. My roomie just uses her identity and sexuality as weapon sometimes", "It doesn't give the roommate the right to force her ideologies on others either just because she has an overly convoluted identity and issues with men. Live, and let live.", "Regardless of gender being a spectrum, how is someone who wants to be called she/her, who dresses as a woman and was born female trans?\u2026.i mean, isn\u2019t that the exact opposite of trans?", "So it\u2019s impossible for her to be closeted bisexual?", "Next time you bang, tape a little baggie with earplugs in it to the outside of your door.", "This is a very mature way to handle this kind of stuff! I kinda want to be your flatmate now :D", "They can only digest small bits of information at a time lol", "Me neither", "Maybe she hears you on the spy cam she installed to watch you ?", "Theres a whole set of nonbinary genders that fall outside the binary, she may identify as one of those, she may not feel comfortable giving you her \u201ctrue\u201d pronouns, she may not feel comfortable changing her presentation right now. Your brother clearly had a strong preference for a set gender and worked hard to achieve that particular goal, but his journey doesn\u2019t invalidate others doing things differently. \nAgain this does not excuse her behaviour or her being an asshole, but pulling her gender identity into question however you feel about it isn\u2019t okay.", "Well right now she's saying she's a lesbian, so why the hell are you assuming her sexuality ? Weird af", "Thanks for letting me know. Like I said I do not judge her whatever she chooses to think, feel, believe, present does not affect my life in any way. I\u2019m an ex Mo so me level of knowledge on all things gender identity and sexuality are slim. But I don\u2019t have a problem with it until it\u2019s weaponized", "Honestly, learn more about it, learn what gender and presentation means to people\u2014 and assholes won\u2019t be able to weaponise it against you. Knowledge, compassion and understanding are excellent defences against bullshit.", "True that, I try to learn as much as I can but it\u2019s super complicated! I respect her pronouns and identity as much as possible but blatantly telling me \u201cas a trans lesbian person a male presence in the apartment makes me uncomfortable\u201d I feel is a little ridiculous. She said that to me within the first few weeks of bringing my bf around", "Again her behaviour is wrong. And has nothing to do with her gender, even if shes trying to connect the two. Don\u2019t fall for it by connecting them!"]}
