NTA.", "You would be TA if you did **NOT** just bluntly tell him that he needs to clean the shower head after every shower from meow on.\n\nI don't deal with toilet paper anymore. I just use the shower as a bidet after my morning dump. It takes a while to perfect the art, but it's much cleaner and better for the environment than toilet paper. But, unless there's an issue with water pressure, he's clearly doing it wrong.\n\nPlease see below for how I've been rocking this method in a safe, clean, and fun manner for the past several years. Please feel free to share these instructions, tips, and tricks with your husband if helpful.\n\n1. It all starts with diet and lifestyle. If your husband is getting poop on the shower head, he's probably taking some nasty dumps. He really should be prioritizing the following: A. Work on stress management; B. Eat more fruits and vegetables; C. Always stay hydrated; D. Enjoy alcohol in moderation; E. Consider the possibility of food allergies and alter diet accordingly; F. Enjoy quality pasture raised meat products in moderation; G. Enjoy a good probiotic food or two, such as kefir, kimchi, or saurkraut; H. Be sure to get 7-9 hours of restful sleep per night; I. Enjoy moderate exercise each day, such as yoga or walking.\n2. Once you've got diet and lifestyle on point, go ahead and begin training yourself to drop your hot one first thing in the morning. Each morning, wake up, drink a glass of water, and pop a squat on the porcelain throne. Now, just wait and watch. Clear your mind. Imagine the sensation of evacuating the bowels. Give yourself 10-20 minutes each morning at the same time. Eventually, your body will take the hint and you'll naturally defecate at the same time each morning going forward.\n3. Now, after each dump, immediately jump in the shower. LEAVE THE SHOWER HEAD WHERE IT IS. DO NOT REMOVE THE SHOWER HEAD AND TRY TO ANGLE IT TOWARDS YOUR BUTTHOLE. Rather, adjust the shower head while leaving it attached to the wall. This is where your yoga skills from tip 1 come in handy. Adjust your butt and spread your cheeks until the water is spraying directly into your butthole. You may need to go into downward dog for this one, depending on where the shower head is positioned.\n4. Do not wash that area with soap. Make sure the water is lukewarm, neither too hot nor too cold. Hot water and conventional soap will irritate the butthole, which will then result in the production of a putrid smell. Be gentle. It's a self-cleaning organ and fecal matter will simply wash away. It's water soluble.\n5. Go ahead and wash the rest of your bod, then come back to the butt for a final spray down, and then go ahead and conclude your shower.\n6. For beginners, when you're done with the shower, go ahead and do a hard wipe. Then, examine the toilet paper and give it a sniff. Is there any discoloration? Is there an odor? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, you need to repeat the process again. If no, you're on the right track. The toilet paper should be completely white, and it should smell like zinc.\n\nIt took me about 6 months to perfect this method. Again, if your husband takes up yoga, he'll develop advanced proprioception and will be able to tell how clean his butt is by felt sense alone. At that point, he can safely give up on toilet paper altogether. I love not having to buy the stuff. I save a lot of money, my drains never clog, and I have more room in my grocery bag for all of those extra organic fruits and veggies.\n\nYou are NTA in this scenario.", "This is exactly what I would do.\n\nCome here.

Also, doing this would involve pooping, taking off all my clothes, spraying my ass *in the tub* and then fully drying off and dressing again. Like\u2026 that is not efficient. \n\nThere is one thing I can think of him using his detached shower head for that *would* be more likely to get poop on it\u2026 which if he\u2019s into that, fine.
