They will usually be already out by the time me and my siblings wake up.\n\nMy sister (16F), lets call her Abby, asked me to send her to her friend\u2019s house at around 1pm to do her group homework. At that point I decided to invite my other sister (18F, let\u2019s call her Leah) to go to the arcade at the mall and eat lunch after sending Abby to her friend\u2019s house for a little bit of sibling outing. Abby tells me she\u2019ll be done around 5-6pm.\n\nAs we were about to leave in my car, My mom calls me and told us that my dad wants to book two hotel rooms (50km away) so we could go to another mall that is near the hotel for dinner and outing. We told them that we had plans today and would finish around 5pm. The reason both of them wants us to come is because they didn\u2019t bring any spare clothes to stay the night at the hotel, so they want us to bring it for them. I told them that I could probably send them the clothes but all three of us didn\u2019t want to stay at the hotel because it was a bit unexpected. I have an online class the next morning around 8am. She said it\u2019s fine then, she suggested that we bring the things for them and we would eat dinner at the mall they\u2019re at and go back home after.\n\nSo I send Abby to her friend\u2019s house, and brought Leah to the nearby mall to eat lunch and play some arcade. Fast forward until around 5.30pm, We go back, pick up Abby and went back home to pack up our parent\u2019s needs. There were unwashed dishes so Abby washes the dishes. After Abby finishes, the time is already around 7pm. And this might be where I went wrong, I decided that me and my siblings go around 7.15pm so to kill the time we played some video games. We usually eat dinner quite late around 8pm so I thought we could be there in time (Should be around 40-50min drive).\n\nMom calls Abby around 7.20 and asks us where we are. Abby told her we are still at home getting ready. Mom gets angry and tells us that they have been waiting at the restaurant. We didn't expected this since we usually have late dinners. She told us that it would be late for me and my siblings to arrive and to go back home. I told her that I\u2019m fine driving late at night but she is not ok with that since i\u2019m also responsible for my siblings. She decides that we don\u2019t need to come, and talked about how my dad doesn\u2019t like to bring us out because we are always late. They decided to cancel the hotel booking since they didn\u2019t have any spare clothes and go back home after they have their dinner.\n\nLeah thinks that it\u2019s our parent\u2019s fault for not planning an outing well (we had to answer on the spot). All three of us were tired after our day. I partly agree with Leah but I think I could\u2019ve done better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699795260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tk3v6/aita_for_being_late_to_my_parents_dinner/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What do your parents do to afford going out every day? Also, I would go crazy if I was expected to be okay with plans sprung on me on the spot. \n\nRegardless of any of that, it's their responsibility to plan accordingly for their funtime. The only wrong I see here from your side is not being firm on the \"no\" when they asked you to drive there to bring them their stuff. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI agree with your sister \u2014  it's *entirely* your parents' fault that they didn't plan their outing better.\n\nNot only did they NOT tell you when they'd booked dinner reservations, they also made plans on a whim (expecting their children to pack their bags for them), and left their filthy dishes lying around.\n\nYour parents are huge AHs.", "I\u2019m confused of why you didn\u2019t grab the clothes and head over. \n\nYou told your mom 5pm so I would have assumed that you would grab the clothes and drive over. That\u2019s the only part I don\u2019t get. Why did it take you 2hrs to grab clothes and wash dishes? You said you told your mom that you would be done by 5 so I cans understand why she booked early.\n\n\nI will say NAH none of y\u2019all used your brain. \n\nMom should have told you a specific time to be there, but I can understand that she assumed that after you picked everyone up at 5 you would head over. I also don\u2019t see a problem with her canceling and heading home to prevent you from driving them in the dark that far away. \n\nI\u2019m still baffled why y\u2019all hung around the house for 2hrs before heading out. But again parents should have told you a time if they know y\u2019all are always late. For your mom to make that comment it means y\u2019all show up late to everything. Unless that\u2019s false. \n\nIt\u2019s a dinner, you missed out on a nice meal \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Y\u2019all built different. \n\nWhen my dad invited us to dinner to eat out, I was there early and ready. It was a treat for us to go out to eat. Maybe every 2 months, he\u2019s a cook so he preferred to cook most meals. \n\nNext time ask what time you should be there, but it\u2019s not a big deal. I would also try not to be late anymore, makes people not want to invite you to anything.", "NTA why would your parents make a dinner reservation without telling you the time? This is their fault.", "ESH this whole group of people is just terrible about communication and is disrespectful of other peoples time.", "ESH - who agrees to dinner without a time?", "Do they do this type of thing a lot? \n\nAs in make you drop your plans and agree to their bidding on a whim? \n\nThis seems incredibly selfish of them especially when you\u2019ve mentioned your invite is more of an afterthought as they needed you to be clothing couriers more than anything else. \n\nThey weren\u2019t really wanting you and your sisters there\u2026 rather they wanted clothing to be brought to them\u2026 which is weird since they could have just bought some new clothing since their hotel seems to have been near a mall? \n\nEither way. NTA.\n\nEdit:  do they also not work? How are they having outings almost everyday?", "YTA.\n\nI cannot understand the decision to wash the dishes upon arriving home (let alone spend even more time playing video games!) instead of proceeding straight to meet your parents. And on several counts, because first I need to point out that how you are planning your timing changes during the post.\n\n1. &#x200B;\n\n\"Leah thinks that it\u2019s our parent\u2019s fault for not planning an outing well\"\n\nHard disagree. When you stated to them that you had plans for the day and would finish around 5pm, that was you providing information to them on an estimated time for meeting them.\n\n2) To make matters worse, that was too early an estimate, as you in fact finished at 5:30pm. At that point, you were running **late**.\n\n3) You end by saying that your parents normally eat late. Implicit in this statement is that you sought to meet your parents at the restaurant exactly on time. I cannot agree with that kind of decision. A dinner invitation where it is your parents' custom to eat late leaves no room for error. You should have planned to arrive early. If you did not know what time to arrive, you should have worked it out with your parents.\n\nOh, wait, you **did**: you told them you had plans for the day and would finish up around 5pm. You scheduled the time, you then were late for that, you delayed still further by washing the dishes, and you're trying to say because your parents eat late you can arrive late, when that's precisely the kind of situation to arrive with a bit of grace for. I can barely follow your reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not agree with the posters who assume your parents made an actual reservation. I see no evidence of that in your post. \\[Edit: And I notice the reply in another comment stating they did not.\\] I think the issue is they were hungry and irritated because they kept expecting you to arrive.", "YTA. Now they know that you can't be counted on.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your parents didn't tell you what time they planned dinner.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu had not agreed on a specific time, so how could you be late?", "NTA they didn\u2019t communicate dinner time, failed to bring their belongings and expected you guys to drop everything to bring their things to them, and left a dish mess to be cleaned.

My time is valuable and if we agree to do something I want you to respect me and my time. They call me the old lady of the group, but if I make time to do something with you or pay for your food, I just ask for the same respect. They love me though and show up on time or call me to adjust times. \n\n Just communicate better next time. Don\u2019t blame yourself."]}
