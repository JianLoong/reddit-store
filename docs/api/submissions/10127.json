However my family is FULL of kids. \nI invited everyone who has children in my family that\u2019s at least visited once\u2019s in the last year, which is ALL the kids attending (11) and followed with inviting my dad, her grandfather. \nAnyways, I reached out to my fianc\u00e9s sister back when she turned 6 months after she canceled \u201cday of\u201d photoshoot of her half birthday. I told her don\u2019t bring her camera to her first birthday and just to be a guest. ONLY his mother had visited our daughter in the past YEAR. Not his sister, aunt, or grandparents. So I invited his mother to the first birthday, and she\u2019s been very helpful planning. \nHer birthdays in 4 days and I told him \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you invited anyone from your family but I didn\u2019t\u201d and he acted shocked. I explained I invited people with children and anyone who\u2019s visited. But he seemed upset. \nI don\u2019t have a way to even invite his family if I wanted to outside of his mom. \nI didn\u2019t want to anyways. They don\u2019t see her. They don\u2019t know her, and she don\u2019t know them. They make no effort. \nSo I told him he\u2019s welcome to ask them whatever but it\u2019s not in the budget and he\u2019d have to figure it out as I\u2019ve figured out the 23 other guest arrangements. \nNow he\u2019s not talking to me but I feel like I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nIt\u2019s HIS family and they should know when her birthday is and or at any point could\u2019ve reached out to ask him if we have plans. \nI don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re planning on doing as it\u2019s at a children\u2019s play area, small slides, small toys, climbing areas, all for children. \nAm I the ass hole for not inviting HIS family?\n\nEdit: I have non stop told him every person and detail along the way.

I invited his mother and she never once mentioned inviting anyone from the family just asked to bring a friend I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve told his entire family when our daughter was 6 months about her first birthday and clarified to his sister not to bring a camera and just to be a guest.

It\u2019s a 1st birthday. It doesn\u2019t matter if your child knows them. She is one for goodness sake. The party is for you not your kid. And they are YOUR family too as he is your fianc\u00e9. Not everyone can uproot their day to come visit others but there is nothing wrong with inviting them anyway. You said after she was born you told everyone they were welcome to come with proper notice. Most people would assume that offer is for the immediate post birth period not any old day.", "YTA. It's not \"HIS family\". It's *your daughter's family*. And if you get married they'll be your family too --to be honest, if you have a child with him they're already your family, anyway. \n\nYou are entitled to dislike them. But you shouldn't let that affect their relationship with your child. I understand they haven't visited, and that could very well be an indicator of a persistent lack of interest. But at this point, she's only been in the world for one year. Way too early for you to be arriving to conclusions and playing petty games. \n\nYou've been planning this for 6 months, and you only thought of telling your fianc\u00e9 so casually, that you didn't invite his family? Come on, now. You did that on purpose. Even if he invites them now, they'll know it's last minute, and they'll feel unwanted. Which is exactly what you want. \n\nOn a side note I think your fianc\u00e9 is a bit of an ass for not taking more active part in planning this event. But to be honest, your post gives me controlling vibes and I get the impression you have been solo planning this mostly out of preference (and he probably enjoyed not being asked to be involved). Still, that doesn't give you a right to unilaterally decide his family is to be excluded. That's why I'm not voting E S H. \n\nAnd don't insult anyone's intelligence by saying you don't know why they'd like to attend to a child play area party being adults. You invited your father who is an adult and presumably doesn't have small children, and you thought that was fine. You even made a point to call him \"her grandfather\". Well, those other childless adults you excluded are also your daughter's aunt and other relatives. \n\nOverall, you're making this child's birthday about you and what you want. She might be a baby, but it's good practice to remember it's HER birthday and the guests should be HER family, to celebrate HER.", "YTA and exhausting", "WTH is a photoshoot for a six month old? Do people celebrate such things now? OP seems a bit extra.", "YTA for creating family drama over a party for a baby.  \n\nI am confused as to why you\u2019re putting the blame on them for not having visited the baby when you don\u2019t have contact info for them - did your fianc\u00e9 invite them over and they declined?  Otherwise, how could they know when they\u2019d be welcome?  You don\u2019t just turn up at the home of someone with an infant, that is the epitome of rude, at least in the US.  And why don\u2019t you have that contact info?  What if your fianc\u00e9 had a medical emergency?", "YTA \n\nYou've taken on planning the event, super far in advance, and didn't let him know to invite people until a few days before? Come on... you seem to be bitter that people haven't visited (I bet you never invited them over to either) but a 1st birthday is the perfect opportunity for them to do so!", "Your post is filled with so many red flags it's hard to begin.\n\nYes, you are the a-hole if there was ***not*** a prior agreement that you were both to make the guest list.  If you took that on or it was assumed and you chose NOT to invite most of his family, yes you are an a-hole.  His shocked reaction in hearing you did not invite most of his family confirms this.\n\nThe other red flag is you outright admit you don't want to invite them, and you make a point of dragging the SIL for canceling the photo shoot when that has nothing to do with the issue at hand . . . so obviously there is a lot of resentment and anger that still has not dissipated after six months.  \n\nThe other red flag is everything is conditional with you . . . people get an invite if they have seen the child or made an effort.  So already your child is only one and you are starting to weed people out of her life.  You don't seem to talk to these people enough to understand why the visits may not have happened, and perhaps there are reasons that are legitimate and they would relish the opportunity to rectify this by attending the birthday party.  But, you will never know as you didn't give them the opportunity.\n\nI predict a very tumultuous and conflict-ridden homelife if you are keeping such close tabs on what people do and don't do for you, and then hold a grudge for months and years.\n\nIf that is not the type of child you want to raise, and children learn from the behavior modeled for them, I cannot suggest strongly enough to change your attitude, and suck it up and invite these people.  Don't stop inviting them ever . . . and *force them to be the ones to establish a non-relationship with you and your family rather than you being the one doing that all by yourself.*", "YTA - you sound exhausting. Also, this party is only for you, your child isn\u2019t going to remember it and by not inviting them you\u2019re just going to make your relationship with them and your fianc\u00e9 worse.\nAlso, you do have a way to invite them, ASK YOUR FIANC\u00c9 for contact information, like an adult.", "YTA, i get that first year you blink and it has passed and you really think about whos been here but eventually they will be your family if your fiance becomes your husband and your treating your said future family as second citizens. this was your opportunity to open the door and tell them are door is open please visit us more as she gets older that first year is nothing to compared to whats to come.", "YTA. Invite his family. Reach out to his mother and let her know the details and ask if his other family would like to come. It\u2019s a party. You\u2019re stressing yourself out and being exclusionary over a first birthday party the kid won\u2019t even remember. These things are for the parents and extended family anyway.", "YTA for numerous reasons!", "How do you not even comprehend that YTA? \n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the in laws have children or if they've seen your child. This isn't \"his\" family, this is YOUR family as in the both of you. How the f do you even come off saying it's outside the budget when you invite 23 other people? Are you trying to alienate your fiance? Better yet, are you trying to ensure you don't get married?\n\nYou are being selfish. You are not thinking about your partner. You are ensuring that your child doesn't have a relationship with his family. You are creating tension and very likely will break up your relationship. The complete lack of understanding and having to ask Reddit shocks me.", "YTA you've been planning for 6 months and didn't discuss the guest list with your partner.  \nFirst birthdays are often filled with adults they will talk amongst themselves - all you need to provide is tea coffee & a slice of birthday cake. \nThis is an opportunity for family to meet and bond with your daughter.", "YTA \n\nThat was passive aggressive nonsense and you know it", "YTA", "YTA - you guys should of had a discussion, you have been in planning mode for this forever.  If you were not inviting his family, he should have known when you made the decision.  I would have been mad at you too.", "Might get downvoted but I think YTA. It sounds like you did all of the planning and inviting so of course he 'acted shocked' when you said you invited no one from his family (besides his mom). Then you let him know 4 days before the event saying you can invite your family if you want BUT it's not in the budget. Um, that means he can't invite anyone. Another **excuse** is that you don't know what his adult family would be doing. The same thing YOUR adult family members will be doing! Eating, drinking, watching the kids run around, watching your 1-year-old child either toddling, crying, or eating (trust me, most 1-year-olds are extremely cranky at their 1st bday). He has a very small family. You should have invited them. You MIL helped you plan, you could have easily asked her to extend the invite to her side or ask for contact info. You're being petty.", "YTA. You need to grow up and understand that for other people, the world does not revolve around your child. Idk how often you invited his family over, but you definitely should have had a discussion with your fiance a long time ago about his family's involvement or lack thereof. You've been planning this party for a year and you wait until a few days before to advise your fiance that you didn't invite his family? That's a dick move.", "Yta. You were in charge of the guest list. You never mentioned to him until days before that you didn\u2019t invite his family. This is totally on you. You seem to harbor quite a bit of distain for his family and it\u2019s likely they picked up on it, which may be contributing to them giving you space.", "Most likely it's you they don't want to hang out with.", "You\u2019re the one having the party, shouldn\u2019t you reach out and invite them?

Stop creating divisions, \nThey don\u2019t see her, because of your stank attitude. No where does your post say you invited them to visit or to the BIRTHDAY PARTY , and they declined. \n\nYet you included your whole family with lots of kids. Your fianc\u00e9 is rightfully upset. \n\nYTA. \ud83d\udea9 immaturity, self absorbed, can\u2019t see the forest from the trees.", "ESH. \n\nIt's not rocket science to know that chances are your fiance would want to have his family included in your daughter's first birthday and as the one planning it, if you didn't have contact info or wasn't sure if they should be invited, you should have spoken to him. Unless they have done something that actually warrants cutting them out, he gets to make decisions about his family attending the event. \n\nHe also could have communicated more clearly with you and asked about his family. He also has the capability to speak up. \n\n>I don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re planning on doing as it\u2019s at a children\u2019s play area, small slides, small toys, climbing areas, all for children.\n\nOh I don't know, spend time with the family? Its not like your 1 year old is going to be running around doing those things without the help of an adult.", "YTA. You could have asked him for their contact info when you sent out invites for your own family, or asked him to invite them himself. Acting like you had no contact info so you couldn\u2019t possibly ask them to the party is the definition of weaponized incompetence. \n\nIt is extremely rude to exclude them because they \u201caren\u2019t as involved\u201d as your family. They probably aren\u2019t involved because you haven\u2019t included them. In fact, you\u2019re excluding them now from a very important event in your daughter\u2019s life. \n\nAlso, at 1 year old, kids don\u2019t care about the party. It\u2019s a chance for grown ups to celebrate together.", "YTA. If you did not know their contact info, why did you not ask? Did you tell him that you intend to invite only your family and ask him to invite his? \n\nAre you mad because your SIL did not have time to attend the 6 month photoshoot?\n\nAs a new mother it is sometimes difficult to understand that the world does revolve around your child. People have life and other interests, worries and family things. Telling someone 6 months in advance that you are going to have a party is not an invitation. If someone mentions me that something will happen six months from now I nod and smile and forget.", "YTA - you need to land your helicopter on this one\n\nYou may want to consider that you are driving away his family and not realizing or understanding your past and current actions. The fact that you are so fixated on a first birthday party probably explains why the in-laws can\u2019t stand being around you. \n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t have the budget for more guests for a child\u2019s birthday party is kind of crazy. A kids family birthday party is not a catered affair. It\u2019s some dogs on the grill, a cheap cake, and maybe some cornhole. \n\nAsk yourself truthfully, why has no one visited, is it my fault or theirs.", "YTA, autism or no. Btw I'm autistic and we are perfectly capable of empathy. We are also REALLY good at rules of etiquette, which you have failed miserably at here. \n\nYou are the one planning the party (obsessing over it, really) so you are the one who issues the invites. Guests do not inquire as to who is invited or invite other  guests on your behalf. Your fiance does not need to send invites if you are doing all the planning. And you should not be excluding people based on some arbitrary rule in your mind related to something you are interpreting as some kind of personal insult. \n\nBasically what you did is to invite the people you want to be there and then came up with a series of implausible excuses for why you didn't invite your half of your child's family.", "YTA, I wouldnt want to visit very often with your Attit\u00fcde. It Was a clearly an AH move. You could have told him in advance to invite his family, which is also YOUR daughter's family.", "YTA", "YTA people have busy lives and a lot to remember. You\u2019re a diva to think people will write down your daughters first birthday party date at 6 months old! They\u2019d be expecting an invite closer to the time.

You could have talked to him about it sooner though. Birthdays that young are for family to get together more than anything as babies don't tend to remember their birthdays. You could have used it as an olive branch, but I also don't fault you for not inviting them. Personally, I wouldn't have either but I also would have informed my SO and let them decide how to proceed, and talk about it.  You both failed to communicate with one another and he failed to step up and participate in planning this event.", "ESH.\n\nYou two are completely failing to communicate effectively - it needs to go both ways (he should be asking and getting more involved, you should be informing him when you make important decisions, and not with under a week notice).\n\nIt does sound like he's a bit of a bigger AH here - it's certainly on him to put in the effort to invite his family, but it sounds like you didn't bring this up until right before the birthday to make sure they wouldn't have time to plan to be there.", "ESH\n\nYou are at most a \"slight ahole\", but your husband and his family are also aholes. I would say that your \"ahole-ness\" is limited to the fact that you should understand based on your past experiences with the large family you have, that a bday party for a 1yo is more a family reunion than a party for a kid.  You should have known to invite other people without kids including some members of your husband's family and some of the reasons for people not getting invites sounds slightly petty.\n\nHowever, your husband should have been part of the planning process instead of putting everything on you and he should have indicated who from his family to invite.  You know some people from his side but couldn't possibly know everyone that should have been invited.  Ultimately he should have made it clear well in advance who should and shouldn't be invited to his kid's party and he should have been the person to invite his family.  Also, unless his family lives far away, they are kind of aholes for not visiting or making some other effort to be in touch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to do it a month in advance at most, unless it\u2019s a wedding.", ">And told them what day MONTHS in advance\n\n... So you invited them? \n\nYou're making no sense. \n\nIf you told his family of your daughter's birthday party date but didn't properly invited, that's beyond rude. If you invited them (which telling them to come and giving them the date and time is), not sure why you told your fianc\u00e9 that you didn't.", "OP mentioned something about the sister in law and cancelling the six month photo, so I thought there was some significance she was placing on it that led to the animosity for the party.", "You are a joined unit. A team. His family is your family now so yes, it is your place to invite them.", "If you are organizing the party and invites, it is standard to send an invite to both families even if you are sure they won't come.  Hubby may have some ownership because he didn't double check with you, but the majority of the fault is on you. Sorry", "Well, you have a child together, so they are your family. Autism does not excuse this type of behavior.", "True, but given the size of her family adding his sounds like a rounding error. Also, given her attitude I bet they wouldn\u2019t come anyway (I certainly wouldn\u2019t attend a party where I\u2019m considered second class).", "My family\u2019s in the budget because they\u2019re paying their way. However my fianc\u00e9s mother offered to pay the children\u2019s entry", "she put herself in charge of the party, when he realized they weren\u2019t invited, she threw it in his face", "Wait, this is highly significant information - your fianc\u00e9 handled the budget and didn\u2019t budget for his family to attend?\n\nEdit:  I now see other comments where this is less clear.  I think we need to break this down further. \n\n- who wanted to have a big party at a venue?  \n\n- who picked the venue and made the reservations?  Were you required to give an exact number of guests, or a range?\n\n- is a meal being served?  If so, is it buffet or plated?  \n\n- does the venue provide the cake, or are you bringing it?\n\n- does any part of this involve assigned seating?", "wait if you bring her to holidays, then have they seen her before? and you say you invited them when you first started planning. but you\u2019ve been planning since she was born right?", "Her birthdays in 4 days and I told him \u201cI don\u2019t know if you invited anyone from your family but I didn\u2019t\u201d and he acted shocked.\n\nYeah you told him with 4 days notice.", "Your title is literally that you did not invite them. Which is it? You did or you didn't?", "But you didn\u2019t invite anyone \u2026. Read your title.", "No, you misunderstand.  They don't want to visit because of you.  Not because the dad isn't there,  it's YOU they do not want to interact with. Why else would his mom not mention anyone else being invited? I'm sure they don't want to be.  I'm sure they all talk about you. \nYou're also the one gatekeeping your child. Being invited to a 1st birthday party isn't the reward for simping over you and the kid (birthing isn't unique sweetie) that you think it is either.\n\nYTA.", "It\u2019s HIS family, but it\u2019s your daughters family too. You planned everything. You\u2019ve been planning forever. It was common sense and natural for him to assume his family knew/ was invited. It IS on you, since you took responsibility. This whole thing sounds like a dramatic mess, anyways. And your lack of empathy that you seem proud about doesn\u2019t help.", "You seem to be searching for a hill to die on about your husband not helping with the party. \n\nIt is very normal for one parent to plan a party while the other just helps out the day of the event. There\u2019s very little to plan and they are not exactly a big deal in terms of workload. Your husband would not be in the wrong to assume that you had invited everyone to the party and not intentionally excluded his family for spite. \n\nAlso you elude in other comments that you told his family about it in advance so he would have believed they were invited. Springing it on him last minute that they are not invited and there was no budget for them is nonsensical behavior.", "I'm not saying they are good people, just pointing out you actively avoided inviting them. Seems like you and your husband should communicate a little better about these things, whether he is completely unaware of your feelings towards his family or whatever, knowingly not inviting his family and throwing your hands up like \"what could I have possibly done??\" is pretty lame. \n\nLike I said, I think ESH, pretty poorly handled by both parties", "Go figure. I wouldn\u2019t want you part of my family either", "ok i see your point i guess if they dont think your worth inviting and they dont bother to contact you then does it really matter if they come", "He\u2019s in a family group chat with them, I was assuming he\u2019s been talking to them or his mom had as I\u2019ve updated them both about who I\u2019ve invited and the budget as it changes. I only thought to ask this week because he\u2019s not mentioned it and neither did his mom. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite them\u201d because I didn\u2019t directly send dates and times and places to them. But I did send it to his mother and himself and every step involved them two.", "Your comment wasn't about the significance the photoshoot could have (hence why I said I don't think it has any), but about how extra that was.", "His sisters a photographer and asked to shoot her 6 month, I do monthly photos for the first year to look back on.", "Where is this birthday party being held? You\u2019re charging an entry fee for a 1 year olds birthday party?  This is very unclassy.\n\nAutism isn\u2019t an excuse for poor judgment and manners.", "Wait wait wait\u2026you\u2019re having guests pay their own way, for your child\u2019s birthday party, which is a part for YOU more than anything.", "Oh that's why she was invited. \n\nNow it's starting to make sense.", "Where does it say she told him not to help?", "OP is all over the place. In other comments she says that her family is paying their own entry fees to the party - so this isn't actually a birthday party but more a play date where every parent pays for their child to enter a playground. So OP's fianc\u00e9 couldn't really have been in charge of the budget, or be actually aware of the cost per person... because most of the guests are paying for themselves. \n\nOP also added that her MIL (fianc\u00e9's mother, the only person from his side that OP invited) offered to pay for the children's entrance. Which makes it even more confusing: the woman is paying for children who aren't her direct family to attend, and everyone else on OP's side are paying for the adult entrance fee only, apparently? \n\nEither way, this isn't a big event in a big venue. OP seems to have spent an entire year planning this yet did the crassest thing possible by having invited people pay for their own assistance. \n\nAnd I don't think her edit about being autistic excuses the back and forth with the information.", "YES! I don\u2019t have the income in our home, he fully has been updated and asked about budgets and people coming this entire time", "Because I don\u2019t have their contact, I have him and his mother and told them every step and person and plan. I just thought he\u2019d invited them since I didn\u2019t and never once mentioned them, it just feels like it should be him or even his mom shooting the family group chat an update.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nShe told them, but didn\u2019t invite them. Making no sense here.", "I updated him and his mother every budget change and planning, they\u2019re the only ones I have contact with. I don\u2019t have his sister and aunt and grandparents but they do. And have been involved with everything including who I\u2019ve invited", "Why do you think that his mother would take it upon herself to invite the rest of the family? That'd be rude and inappropriate, it's not her party. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should've been more hands on, that's on him. But why would he assume his family wasn't invited when you invited your own? You were handling almost everything (sharing details isn't involving him, he didn't plan a thing, for the way you speak, you merely told him what you were doing) and decided on your own that you wouldn't invite his family and wouldn't say anything about it until 4 days before the party. \n\nMy vote stands. YTA.", "You desperately need to work on your communication skills.\n\nDesperately.", "It\u2019s at a kids play place. The comment about autism isn\u2019t to excuse anything in the post just that I can\u2019t empathize", "My family offered to pay for their food at the restaurant AFTER they play, we pay the kids entry fee which is already $200.", "I think OP is lying and just adding more comments to turn the voting.", "Yes your husband has a level of responsibility in this. This really demonstrates that you are both not communicating well with one another.\nYou have said you were organising the party. Did you ask him prior this if he wanted to invite his family ?  An easy follow on from that question would be that he would need to do the inviting as you don't have their contact details. \n\nI agree that your husband needs to step up here with regards to his family. Ask him if he has discussed the party on the family chat.  \n\nIt's not your mother in laws responsibility to invite guests unless you requested her to do so.", "\u201cI\u2019m having a party and you are not invited\u201d", "You don\u2019t need to empathize. It\u2019s common sense. If you\u2019re having a birthday party for your daughter. You invite both sides of the immediate family unless there\u2019s some significant reason you cannot, those reasons should be discussed with your partner (budget, space, animosity etc). You made a lot of assumptions and communicated poorly. You also ostracize his family by saying and emphasizing they are \u201cHIS\u201d and have nothing to do with you/ your daughter. Get a grip, everyone on here agrees YTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve been planning this purportedly since your daughter was in the womb.", "I'm sorry, but it's incredibly crass to throw a party and make the guests pay entrance fees. \n\nAlso, in a different comment you say that your fianc\u00e9 was in charge of the budget and he was the one paying so he \"was aware of who was coming\". How can he be in charge of budget if, according to you, your family are all paying for themselves, and your MIL offered to pay for your side of the family's children entrances? He would have no idea what exactly he was paying for.", "Here\u2019s a piece of advice for future parties - you are the host so you pay for everything and everyone. If you can\u2019t afford it, then have the party you can afford.", "Considering how she's arguing against most the Y T A votes, I agree. And I'm sure she didn't think people would vote her the AH when she posted.", "Also \"I didn't invite them because they never visited and I don't think they should come\" is in the post, but all her comments are about \"I did tell them and I wanted them to come, but I think it should be him who invite them and if he didn't then that's his fault\". \n\nNow the edit about having autism as if it's meant to change anything.\n\nThis whole post is a joke."]}
