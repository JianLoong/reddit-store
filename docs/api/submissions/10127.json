However my family is FULL of kids. \nI invited everyone who has children in my family that\u2019s at least visited once\u2019s in the last year, which is ALL the kids attending (11) and followed with inviting my dad, her grandfather. \nAnyways, I reached out to my fianc\u00e9s sister back when she turned 6 months after she canceled \u201cday of\u201d photoshoot of her half birthday. I told her don\u2019t bring her camera to her first birthday and just to be a guest. ONLY his mother had visited our daughter in the past YEAR. Not his sister, aunt, or grandparents. So I invited his mother to the first birthday, and she\u2019s been very helpful planning. \nHer birthdays in 4 days and I told him \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you invited anyone from your family but I didn\u2019t\u201d and he acted shocked. I explained I invited people with children and anyone who\u2019s visited.

They don\u2019t know her, and she don\u2019t know them. They make no effort. \nSo I told him he\u2019s welcome to ask them whatever but it\u2019s not in the budget and he\u2019d have to figure it out as I\u2019ve figured out the 23 other guest arrangements. \nNow he\u2019s not talking to me but I feel like I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nIt\u2019s HIS family and they should know when her birthday is and or at any point could\u2019ve reached out to ask him if we have plans. \nI don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re planning on doing as it\u2019s at a children\u2019s play area, small slides, small toys, climbing areas, all for children. \nAm I the ass hole for not inviting HIS family?\n\nEdit: I have non stop told him every person and detail along the way.

It\u2019s a 1st birthday. It doesn\u2019t matter if your child knows them. She is one for goodness sake. The party is for you not your kid. And they are YOUR family too as he is your fianc\u00e9. Not everyone can uproot their day to come visit others but there is nothing wrong with inviting them anyway. You said after she was born you told everyone they were welcome to come with proper notice. Most people would assume that offer is for the immediate post birth period not any old day.", "YTA. It's not \"HIS family\". It's *your daughter's family*. And if you get married they'll be your family too --to be honest, if you have a child with him they're already your family, anyway. \n\nYou are entitled to dislike them. But you shouldn't let that affect their relationship with your child. I understand they haven't visited, and that could very well be an indicator of a persistent lack of interest. But at this point, she's only been in the world for one year. Way too early for you to be arriving to conclusions and playing petty games. \n\nYou've been planning this for 6 months, and you only thought of telling your fianc\u00e9 so casually, that you didn't invite his family? Come on, now. You did that on purpose. Even if he invites them now, they'll know it's last minute, and they'll feel unwanted. Which is exactly what you want. \n\nOn a side note I think your fianc\u00e9 is a bit of an ass for not taking more active part in planning this event. But to be honest, your post gives me controlling vibes and I get the impression you have been solo planning this mostly out of preference (and he probably enjoyed not being asked to be involved). Still, that doesn't give you a right to unilaterally decide his family is to be excluded. That's why I'm not voting E S H. \n\nAnd don't insult anyone's intelligence by saying you don't know why they'd like to attend to a child play area party being adults. You invited your father who is an adult and presumably doesn't have small children, and you thought that was fine. You even made a point to call him \"her grandfather\". Well, those other childless adults you excluded are also your daughter's aunt and other relatives. \n\nOverall, you're making this child's birthday about you and what you want. She might be a baby, but it's good practice to remember it's HER birthday and the guests should be HER family, to celebrate HER.", "YTA and exhausting", "WTH is a photoshoot for a six month old? Do people celebrate such things now? OP seems a bit extra.", "YTA for creating family drama over a party for a baby.  \n\nI am confused as to why you\u2019re putting the blame on them for not having visited the baby when you don\u2019t have contact info for them - did your fianc\u00e9 invite them over and they declined?  Otherwise, how could they know when they\u2019d be welcome?  You don\u2019t just turn up at the home of someone with an infant, that is the epitome of rude, at least in the US.  And why don\u2019t you have that contact info?  What if your fianc\u00e9 had a medical emergency?", "YTA \n\nYou've taken on planning the event, super far in advance, and didn't let him know to invite people until a few days before? Come on... you seem to be bitter that people haven't visited (I bet you never invited them over to either) but a 1st birthday is the perfect opportunity for them to do so!", "Your post is filled with so many red flags it's hard to begin.\n\nYes, you are the a-hole if there was ***not*** a prior agreement that you were both to make the guest list.  If you took that on or it was assumed and you chose NOT to invite most of his family, yes you are an a-hole.  His shocked reaction in hearing you did not invite most of his family confirms this.\n\nThe other red flag is you outright admit you don't want to invite them, and you make a point of dragging the SIL for canceling the photo shoot when that has nothing to do with the issue at hand . . . so obviously there is a lot of resentment and anger that still has not dissipated after six months.  \n\nThe other red flag is everything is conditional with you . . . people get an invite if they have seen the child or made an effort.  So already your child is only one and you are starting to weed people out of her life.  You don't seem to talk to these people enough to understand why the visits may not have happened, and perhaps there are reasons that are legitimate and they would relish the opportunity to rectify this by attending the birthday party.  But, you will never know as you didn't give them the opportunity.\n\nI predict a very tumultuous and conflict-ridden homelife if you are keeping such close tabs on what people do and don't do for you, and then hold a grudge for months and years.\n\nIf that is not the type of child you want to raise, and children learn from the behavior modeled for them, I cannot suggest strongly enough to change your attitude, and suck it up and invite these people.  Don't stop inviting them ever . . . and *force them to be the ones to establish a non-relationship with you and your family rather than you being the one doing that all by yourself.*", "YTA - you sound exhausting. Also, this party is only for you, your child isn\u2019t going to remember it and by not inviting them you\u2019re just going to make your relationship with them and your fianc\u00e9 worse.\nAlso, you do have a way to invite them, ASK YOUR FIANC\u00c9 for contact information, like an adult.\n\nEdit: as has been said about a million times here being autistic is not an excuse to be an AH.", "YTA, i get that first year you blink and it has passed and you really think about whos been here but eventually they will be your family if your fiance becomes your husband and your treating your said future family as second citizens. this was your opportunity to open the door and tell them are door is open please visit us more as she gets older that first year is nothing to compared to whats to come.", "YTA. Invite his family. Reach out to his mother and let her know the details and ask if his other family would like to come. It\u2019s a party. You\u2019re stressing yourself out and being exclusionary over a first birthday party the kid won\u2019t even remember. These things are for the parents and extended family anyway.", "YTA for numerous reasons!", "How do you not even comprehend that YTA? \n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the in laws have children or if they've seen your child. This isn't \"his\" family, this is YOUR family as in the both of you. How the f do you even come off saying it's outside the budget when you invite 23 other people? Are you trying to alienate your fiance? Better yet, are you trying to ensure you don't get married?\n\nYou are being selfish. You are not thinking about your partner. You are ensuring that your child doesn't have a relationship with his family. You are creating tension and very likely will break up your relationship. The complete lack of understanding and having to ask Reddit shocks me.", "YTA you've been planning for 6 months and didn't discuss the guest list with your partner.  \nFirst birthdays are often filled with adults they will talk amongst themselves - all you need to provide is tea coffee & a slice of birthday cake. \nThis is an opportunity for family to meet and bond with your daughter.", "YTA \n\nThat was passive aggressive nonsense and you know it", "YTA", "YTA - you guys should of had a discussion, you have been in planning mode for this forever.  If you were not inviting his family, he should have known when you made the decision.  I would have been mad at you too.", "Might get downvoted but I think YTA. It sounds like you did all of the planning and inviting so of course he 'acted shocked' when you said you invited no one from his family (besides his mom). Then you let him know 4 days before the event saying you can invite your family if you want BUT it's not in the budget. Um, that means he can't invite anyone. Another **excuse** is that you don't know what his adult family would be doing. The same thing YOUR adult family members will be doing! Eating, drinking, watching the kids run around, watching your 1-year-old child either toddling, crying, or eating (trust me, most 1-year-olds are extremely cranky at their 1st bday). He has a very small family. You should have invited them. You MIL helped you plan, you could have easily asked her to extend the invite to her side or ask for contact info. You're being petty.", "YTA. You need to grow up and understand that for other people, the world does not revolve around your child. Idk how often you invited his family over, but you definitely should have had a discussion with your fiance a long time ago about his family's involvement or lack thereof. You've been planning this party for a year and you wait until a few days before to advise your fiance that you didn't invite his family? That's a dick move.", "Yta. You were in charge of the guest list. You never mentioned to him until days before that you didn\u2019t invite his family. This is totally on you. You seem to harbor quite a bit of distain for his family and it\u2019s likely they picked up on it, which may be contributing to them giving you space.", "Most likely it's you they don't want to hang out with.", "You\u2019re the one having the party, shouldn\u2019t you reach out and invite them? You managed to invite your whole side of the family. \nThey\u2019re not \u201chis\u201d family. It\u2019s also your daughters grandma, aunt, and so forth. Stop creating divisions, \nThey don\u2019t see her, because of your stank attitude. No where does your post say you invited them to visit or to the BIRTHDAY PARTY , and they declined. \n\nYet you included your whole family with lots of kids. Your fianc\u00e9 is rightfully upset. \n\nYTA. \ud83d\udea9 immaturity, self absorbed, can\u2019t see the forest from the trees.", "ESH. \n\nIt's not rocket science to know that chances are your fiance would want to have his family included in your daughter's first birthday and as the one planning it, if you didn't have contact info or wasn't sure if they should be invited, you should have spoken to him. Unless they have done something that actually warrants cutting them out, he gets to make decisions about his family attending the event. \n\nHe also could have communicated more clearly with you and asked about his family. He also has the capability to speak up. \n\n>I don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re planning on doing as it\u2019s at a children\u2019s play area, small slides, small toys, climbing areas, all for children.\n\nOh I don't know, spend time with the family? Its not like your 1 year old is going to be running around doing those things without the help of an adult.", "YTA. You could have asked him for their contact info when you sent out invites for your own family, or asked him to invite them himself. Acting like you had no contact info so you couldn\u2019t possibly ask them to the party is the definition of weaponized incompetence. \n\nIt is extremely rude to exclude them because they \u201caren\u2019t as involved\u201d as your family. They probably aren\u2019t involved because you haven\u2019t included them. In fact, you\u2019re excluding them now from a very important event in your daughter\u2019s life. \n\nAlso, at 1 year old, kids don\u2019t care about the party. It\u2019s a chance for grown ups to celebrate together.", "YTA. If you did not know their contact info, why did you not ask? Did you tell him that you intend to invite only your family and ask him to invite his? \n\nAre you mad because your SIL did not have time to attend the 6 month photoshoot?\n\nAs a new mother it is sometimes difficult to understand that the world does revolve around your child. People have life and other interests, worries and family things. Telling someone 6 months in advance that you are going to have a party is not an invitation. If someone mentions me that something will happen six months from now I nod and smile and forget.", "YTA - you need to land your helicopter on this one\n\nYou may want to consider that you are driving away his family and not realizing or understanding your past and current actions. The fact that you are so fixated on a first birthday party probably explains why the in-laws can\u2019t stand being around you. \n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t have the budget for more guests for a child\u2019s birthday party is kind of crazy. A kids family birthday party is not a catered affair. It\u2019s some dogs on the grill, a cheap cake, and maybe some cornhole. \n\nAsk yourself truthfully, why has no one visited, is it my fault or theirs.", "YTA, autism or no. Btw I'm autistic and we are perfectly capable of empathy. We are also REALLY good at rules of etiquette, which you have failed miserably at here. \n\nYou are the one planning the party (obsessing over it, really) so you are the one who issues the invites. Guests do not inquire as to who is invited or invite other  guests on your behalf. Your fiance does not need to send invites if you are doing all the planning. And you should not be excluding people based on some arbitrary rule in your mind related to something you are interpreting as some kind of personal insult. \n\nBasically what you did is to invite the people you want to be there and then came up with a series of implausible excuses for why you didn't invite your half of your child's family.", "YTA, I wouldnt want to visit very often with your Attit\u00fcde. It Was a clearly an AH move. You could have told him in advance to invite his family, which is also YOUR daughter's family.", "YTA", "YTA people have busy lives and a lot to remember. You\u2019re a diva to think people will write down your daughters first birthday party date at 6 months old! They\u2019d be expecting an invite closer to the time.

He presumed you weren\u2019t going to be a complete asshole and exclude his family.", "[removed]", "I'm going to say ESH because if he wanted his family there, he shouldn't have expected you to do all the work to invite people yourself. You could have talked to him about it sooner though. Birthdays that young are for family to get together more than anything as babies don't tend to remember their birthdays. You could have used it as an olive branch, but I also don't fault you for not inviting them. Personally, I wouldn't have either but I also would have informed my SO and let them decide how to proceed, and talk about it.  You both failed to communicate with one another and he failed to step up and participate in planning this event.", "ESH.\n\nYou two are completely failing to communicate effectively - it needs to go both ways (he should be asking and getting more involved, you should be informing him when you make important decisions, and not with under a week notice).\n\nIt does sound like he's a bit of a bigger AH here - it's certainly on him to put in the effort to invite his family, but it sounds like you didn't bring this up until right before the birthday to make sure they wouldn't have time to plan to be there.", "ESH\n\nYou are at most a \"slight ahole\", but your husband and his family are also aholes. I would say that your \"ahole-ness\" is limited to the fact that you should understand based on your past experiences with the large family you have, that a bday party for a 1yo is more a family reunion than a party for a kid.  You should have known to invite other people without kids including some members of your husband's family and some of the reasons for people not getting invites sounds slightly petty.\n\nHowever, your husband should have been part of the planning process instead of putting everything on you and he should have indicated who from his family to invite.  You know some people from his side but couldn't possibly know everyone that should have been invited.  Ultimately he should have made it clear well in advance who should and shouldn't be invited to his kid's party and he should have been the person to invite his family.  Also, unless his family lives far away, they are kind of aholes for not visiting or making some other effort to be in touch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NOPE NOPE NOPE. It should be 50/50.\n\nSo I want to be clear: my words to OP apply just as much to neurotypical people.  I scolded her in this specific instance because she's not even trying. But you are also right that people should TRY to be thoughtful of YOU as well . . . you're a person, your feelings have value and you deserve that. As an autistic person you deserve to be treated with empathy as much as anyone else does.", "And how much were you going to pay her?", "ok if everyone\u2019s avoiding her for it then he should invite his family and tell them lol", "I don\u2019t think she wants sympathy.. she has clarified that she is autistic (implying that her views of and actions in social situation are different than most other people\u2019s) & seems to just want to understand if/why she WBTA in this scenario", "she states in other comments that she had let his family know about the party in a group chat (in a way that indicates open invitation), then stated 4 days before the party that they weren\u2019t invited.", "Because she has been planning this since the babies birth.", "My in laws don\u2019t like me and will only see the baby when my husband takes him over without me. I just threw my little dude his birthday party and none of them were invited.", "There could be a lot of reasons for this. There\u2019s still a pandemic going on, for one. RSV and whooping cough are at an all time high, and babies don\u2019t have much immunity to anything at all. \n\nCost of everything like gas (and subsequently, the value of time) has gone up. They could be working to pay their life expenses. Or, another possibility is that they don\u2019t want to \u201csuffocate\u201d OP and their partner. Especially the first year of having a baby. It\u2019s exciting, sure, but also a valuable time for families to find their routine and establish lifelong bonds. \n\nThe fact is: we don\u2019t know the reason why they don\u2019t visit as often as OP\u2019s family, and it\u2019s not the most important contextual detail. \n\nOP has made it obvious that the baby\u2019s first birthday is a very important event and that it means a lot to them and their family. OP went above and beyond in planning the event to make sure it was good memories for everyone involved. And then, as an extension of that, blatantly decided to not include the baby\u2019s other side of the family; thus isolating them from this big, important event and excluding them from the happy memories. \n\nRegardless on whether or not they visit a lot or visit very little, or even not at all\u2026 a baby\u2019s first birthday could have been a great opportunity to open the door on communication and welcome them into the baby\u2019s life as extended family.\n\nOP \u2014 YTA.", "[deleted]", "That is so validating, and extremely true to my personal experience. Thank you for that, seriously.", "Wow. Planned a birthday for six months that you made everyone else pay for. His family is lucky they weren\u2019t invited. What a horrible party", "It's so wild because I'm autistic and have so much empathy for other humans that it's literally painful sometimes. Autism isn't an excuse to not empathize, and you can also learn how to if you really wanted to.", "It\u2019s not, it\u2019s still extra to me. Idk why parents feel the need to post their kids everywhere lol", "I know. What is the truth?", "She\u2019s not in the group chat; he and his mom are", "She didn\u2019t invite the sister. Invitees get told the party details beyond the date.", "...no she didn't?", ">we\u2019re both too empathetic for our own good. \n\nSAME (except he's my son, not daughter)\n\nAlso, all the autistics I know in face-to-face life are also too empathetic for out own good... hyperaware of others' emotions and reactions, because we've gotten yelled at so often by NTs for not reading their minds and/or not following unspoken rules...", "She did but then didn\u2019t. She told her not to bring a camera and just come as a guest, then just never sent her any follow up info. It was deliberate, and she used the common \u201cI have autism\u201d excuse for being an ass.", "I call BS a bit, 1 year and haven't even seen the kid? I'm assuming they are somewhat nearby..  \n\n\nWhy should she assume they're even interested? they've made no effort?", "[deleted]", "I have experienced it too\u2026 so many times!", "She didn't say that in any comments"]}
