However my family is FULL of kids. \nI invited everyone who has children in my family that\u2019s at least visited once\u2019s in the last year, which is ALL the kids attending (11) and followed with inviting my dad, her grandfather. \nAnyways, I reached out to my fianc\u00e9s sister back when she turned 6 months after she canceled \u201cday of\u201d photoshoot of her half birthday. I told her don\u2019t bring her camera to her first birthday and just to be a guest. ONLY his mother had visited our daughter in the past YEAR. Not his sister, aunt, or grandparents. So I invited his mother to the first birthday, and she\u2019s been very helpful planning. \nHer birthdays in 4 days and I told him \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you invited anyone from your family but I didn\u2019t\u201d and he acted shocked. I explained I invited people with children and anyone who\u2019s visited. But he seemed upset. \nI don\u2019t have a way to even invite his family if I wanted to outside of his mom. \nI didn\u2019t want to anyways. They don\u2019t see her. They don\u2019t know her, and she don\u2019t know them. They make no effort. \nSo I told him he\u2019s welcome to ask them whatever but it\u2019s not in the budget and he\u2019d have to figure it out as I\u2019ve figured out the 23 other guest arrangements. \nNow he\u2019s not talking to me but I feel like I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nIt\u2019s HIS family and they should know when her birthday is and or at any point could\u2019ve reached out to ask him if we have plans. \nI don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re planning on doing as it\u2019s at a children\u2019s play area, small slides, small toys, climbing areas, all for children. \nAm I the ass hole for not inviting HIS family?\n\nEdit: I have non stop told him every person and detail along the way.

It\u2019s a 1st birthday. It doesn\u2019t matter if your child knows them. She is one for goodness sake. The party is for you not your kid. And they are YOUR family too as he is your fianc\u00e9. Not everyone can uproot their day to come visit others but there is nothing wrong with inviting them anyway. You said after she was born you told everyone they were welcome to come with proper notice. Most people would assume that offer is for the immediate post birth period not any old day.", "YTA. It's not \"HIS family\". It's *your daughter's family*. And if you get married they'll be your family too --to be honest, if you have a child with him they're already your family, anyway. \n\nYou are entitled to dislike them. But you shouldn't let that affect their relationship with your child. I understand they haven't visited, and that could very well be an indicator of a persistent lack of interest. But at this point, she's only been in the world for one year. Way too early for you to be arriving to conclusions and playing petty games. \n\nYou've been planning this for 6 months, and you only thought of telling your fianc\u00e9 so casually, that you didn't invite his family? Come on, now. You did that on purpose. Even if he invites them now, they'll know it's last minute, and they'll feel unwanted. Which is exactly what you want. \n\nOn a side note I think your fianc\u00e9 is a bit of an ass for not taking more active part in planning this event. But to be honest, your post gives me controlling vibes and I get the impression you have been solo planning this mostly out of preference (and he probably enjoyed not being asked to be involved). Still, that doesn't give you a right to unilaterally decide his family is to be excluded. That's why I'm not voting E S H. \n\nAnd don't insult anyone's intelligence by saying you don't know why they'd like to attend to a child play area party being adults. You invited your father who is an adult and presumably doesn't have small children, and you thought that was fine. You even made a point to call him \"her grandfather\". Well, those other childless adults you excluded are also your daughter's aunt and other relatives. \n\nOverall, you're making this child's birthday about you and what you want. She might be a baby, but it's good practice to remember it's HER birthday and the guests should be HER family, to celebrate HER.", "YTA and exhausting", "WTH is a photoshoot for a six month old? Do people celebrate such things now? OP seems a bit extra.", "YTA for creating family drama over a party for a baby.  \n\nI am confused as to why you\u2019re putting the blame on them for not having visited the baby when you don\u2019t have contact info for them - did your fianc\u00e9 invite them over and they declined?  Otherwise, how could they know when they\u2019d be welcome?  You don\u2019t just turn up at the home of someone with an infant, that is the epitome of rude, at least in the US.  And why don\u2019t you have that contact info?  What if your fianc\u00e9 had a medical emergency?", "YTA \n\nYou've taken on planning the event, super far in advance, and didn't let him know to invite people until a few days before? Come on... you seem to be bitter that people haven't visited (I bet you never invited them over to either) but a 1st birthday is the perfect opportunity for them to do so!", "Your post is filled with so many red flags it's hard to begin.\n\nYes, you are the a-hole if there was ***not*** a prior agreement that you were both to make the guest list.  If you took that on or it was assumed and you chose NOT to invite most of his family, yes you are an a-hole.  His shocked reaction in hearing you did not invite most of his family confirms this.\n\nThe other red flag is you outright admit you don't want to invite them, and you make a point of dragging the SIL for canceling the photo shoot when that has nothing to do with the issue at hand . . . so obviously there is a lot of resentment and anger that still has not dissipated after six months.  \n\nThe other red flag is everything is conditional with you . . . people get an invite if they have seen the child or made an effort.  So already your child is only one and you are starting to weed people out of her life.  You don't seem to talk to these people enough to understand why the visits may not have happened, and perhaps there are reasons that are legitimate and they would relish the opportunity to rectify this by attending the birthday party.  But, you will never know as you didn't give them the opportunity.\n\nI predict a very tumultuous and conflict-ridden homelife if you are keeping such close tabs on what people do and don't do for you, and then hold a grudge for months and years.\n\nIf that is not the type of child you want to raise, and children learn from the behavior modeled for them, I cannot suggest strongly enough to change your attitude, and suck it up and invite these people.  Don't stop inviting them ever . . . and *force them to be the ones to establish a non-relationship with you and your family rather than you being the one doing that all by yourself.*", "YTA - you sound exhausting. Also, this party is only for you, your child isn\u2019t going to remember it and by not inviting them you\u2019re just going to make your relationship with them and your fianc\u00e9 worse.\nAlso, you do have a way to invite them, ASK YOUR FIANC\u00c9 for contact information, like an adult.\n\nEdit: as has been said about a million times here being autistic is not an excuse to be an AH.", "YTA, i get that first year you blink and it has passed and you really think about whos been here but eventually they will be your family if your fiance becomes your husband and your treating your said future family as second citizens. this was your opportunity to open the door and tell them are door is open please visit us more as she gets older that first year is nothing to compared to whats to come.", "YTA. Invite his family. Reach out to his mother and let her know the details and ask if his other family would like to come. It\u2019s a party. You\u2019re stressing yourself out and being exclusionary over a first birthday party the kid won\u2019t even remember. These things are for the parents and extended family anyway.", "YTA for numerous reasons!", "How do you not even comprehend that YTA? \n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the in laws have children or if they've seen your child. This isn't \"his\" family, this is YOUR family as in the both of you. How the f do you even come off saying it's outside the budget when you invite 23 other people? Are you trying to alienate your fiance? Better yet, are you trying to ensure you don't get married?\n\nYou are being selfish. You are not thinking about your partner. You are ensuring that your child doesn't have a relationship with his family. You are creating tension and very likely will break up your relationship. The complete lack of understanding and having to ask Reddit shocks me.", "YTA you've been planning for 6 months and didn't discuss the guest list with your partner.  \nFirst birthdays are often filled with adults they will talk amongst themselves - all you need to provide is tea coffee & a slice of birthday cake. \nThis is an opportunity for family to meet and bond with your daughter.", "YTA \n\nThat was passive aggressive nonsense and you know it", "YTA", "YTA - you guys should of had a discussion, you have been in planning mode for this forever.  If you were not inviting his family, he should have known when you made the decision.  I would have been mad at you too.", "Might get downvoted but I think YTA. It sounds like you did all of the planning and inviting so of course he 'acted shocked' when you said you invited no one from his family (besides his mom). Then you let him know 4 days before the event saying you can invite your family if you want BUT it's not in the budget. Um, that means he can't invite anyone. Another **excuse** is that you don't know what his adult family would be doing. The same thing YOUR adult family members will be doing! Eating, drinking, watching the kids run around, watching your 1-year-old child either toddling, crying, or eating (trust me, most 1-year-olds are extremely cranky at their 1st bday). He has a very small family. You should have invited them. You MIL helped you plan, you could have easily asked her to extend the invite to her side or ask for contact info. You're being petty.", "YTA. You need to grow up and understand that for other people, the world does not revolve around your child. Idk how often you invited his family over, but you definitely should have had a discussion with your fiance a long time ago about his family's involvement or lack thereof. You've been planning this party for a year and you wait until a few days before to advise your fiance that you didn't invite his family? That's a dick move.", "Yta. You were in charge of the guest list. You never mentioned to him until days before that you didn\u2019t invite his family. This is totally on you. You seem to harbor quite a bit of distain for his family and it\u2019s likely they picked up on it, which may be contributing to them giving you space.", "Most likely it's you they don't want to hang out with.", "You\u2019re the one having the party, shouldn\u2019t you reach out and invite them? You managed to invite your whole side of the family. \nThey\u2019re not \u201chis\u201d family. It\u2019s also your daughters grandma, aunt, and so forth. Stop creating divisions, \nThey don\u2019t see her, because of your stank attitude. No where does your post say you invited them to visit or to the BIRTHDAY PARTY , and they declined. \n\nYet you included your whole family with lots of kids. Your fianc\u00e9 is rightfully upset. \n\nYTA. \ud83d\udea9 immaturity, self absorbed, can\u2019t see the forest from the trees.", "ESH. \n\nIt's not rocket science to know that chances are your fiance would want to have his family included in your daughter's first birthday and as the one planning it, if you didn't have contact info or wasn't sure if they should be invited, you should have spoken to him. Unless they have done something that actually warrants cutting them out, he gets to make decisions about his family attending the event. \n\nHe also could have communicated more clearly with you and asked about his family. He also has the capability to speak up. \n\n>I don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re planning on doing as it\u2019s at a children\u2019s play area, small slides, small toys, climbing areas, all for children.\n\nOh I don't know, spend time with the family? Its not like your 1 year old is going to be running around doing those things without the help of an adult.", "YTA. You could have asked him for their contact info when you sent out invites for your own family, or asked him to invite them himself. Acting like you had no contact info so you couldn\u2019t possibly ask them to the party is the definition of weaponized incompetence. \n\nIt is extremely rude to exclude them because they \u201caren\u2019t as involved\u201d as your family. They probably aren\u2019t involved because you haven\u2019t included them. In fact, you\u2019re excluding them now from a very important event in your daughter\u2019s life. \n\nAlso, at 1 year old, kids don\u2019t care about the party. It\u2019s a chance for grown ups to celebrate together.", "YTA. If you did not know their contact info, why did you not ask? Did you tell him that you intend to invite only your family and ask him to invite his? \n\nAre you mad because your SIL did not have time to attend the 6 month photoshoot?\n\nAs a new mother it is sometimes difficult to understand that the world does revolve around your child. People have life and other interests, worries and family things. Telling someone 6 months in advance that you are going to have a party is not an invitation. If someone mentions me that something will happen six months from now I nod and smile and forget.", "YTA - you need to land your helicopter on this one\n\nYou may want to consider that you are driving away his family and not realizing or understanding your past and current actions. The fact that you are so fixated on a first birthday party probably explains why the in-laws can\u2019t stand being around you. \n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t have the budget for more guests for a child\u2019s birthday party is kind of crazy. A kids family birthday party is not a catered affair. It\u2019s some dogs on the grill, a cheap cake, and maybe some cornhole. \n\nAsk yourself truthfully, why has no one visited, is it my fault or theirs.", "YTA, autism or no. Btw I'm autistic and we are perfectly capable of empathy. We are also REALLY good at rules of etiquette, which you have failed miserably at here. \n\nYou are the one planning the party (obsessing over it, really) so you are the one who issues the invites. Guests do not inquire as to who is invited or invite other  guests on your behalf. Your fiance does not need to send invites if you are doing all the planning. And you should not be excluding people based on some arbitrary rule in your mind related to something you are interpreting as some kind of personal insult. \n\nBasically what you did is to invite the people you want to be there and then came up with a series of implausible excuses for why you didn't invite your half of your child's family.", "YTA, I wouldnt want to visit very often with your Attit\u00fcde. It Was a clearly an AH move. You could have told him in advance to invite his family, which is also YOUR daughter's family.", "YTA", "YTA people have busy lives and a lot to remember. You\u2019re a diva to think people will write down your daughters first birthday party date at 6 months old! They\u2019d be expecting an invite closer to the time.

You could have talked to him about it sooner though. Birthdays that young are for family to get together more than anything as babies don't tend to remember their birthdays. You could have used it as an olive branch, but I also don't fault you for not inviting them. Personally, I wouldn't have either but I also would have informed my SO and let them decide how to proceed, and talk about it.  You both failed to communicate with one another and he failed to step up and participate in planning this event.", "ESH.\n\nYou two are completely failing to communicate effectively - it needs to go both ways (he should be asking and getting more involved, you should be informing him when you make important decisions, and not with under a week notice).\n\nIt does sound like he's a bit of a bigger AH here - it's certainly on him to put in the effort to invite his family, but it sounds like you didn't bring this up until right before the birthday to make sure they wouldn't have time to plan to be there.", "ESH\n\nYou are at most a \"slight ahole\", but your husband and his family are also aholes. I would say that your \"ahole-ness\" is limited to the fact that you should understand based on your past experiences with the large family you have, that a bday party for a 1yo is more a family reunion than a party for a kid.  You should have known to invite other people without kids including some members of your husband's family and some of the reasons for people not getting invites sounds slightly petty.\n\nHowever, your husband should have been part of the planning process instead of putting everything on you and he should have indicated who from his family to invite.  You know some people from his side but couldn't possibly know everyone that should have been invited.  Ultimately he should have made it clear well in advance who should and shouldn't be invited to his kid's party and he should have been the person to invite his family.  Also, unless his family lives far away, they are kind of aholes for not visiting or making some other effort to be in touch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You both should have established what you wanted and your expectations. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9's the baby's father and should have been involved in the planning process or at least the invitations to the event.\n\nIt's basic social etiquette that your fianc\u00e9's family should have been invited in a more concrete way, even if only by image in a group text with an RSVP. Especially if your fianc\u00e9 is fronting the bill/your MIL is invited. Even having your fianc\u00e9 or future MIL involved in the inviting of that side of the family would be preferable.

This is an event that her baby won\u2019t care about.\n\nOn my first baby\u2019s first birthday I also planned a multi-generational party and it was terrible. The party went fine, the guests didn\u2019t notice anything was amiss, but I was busy being triggered being one year on from the traumatic birth of my daughter and having to try and put on a face of happiness for the guests.

You have no respect for him or his family. You are so upset about what they haven\u2019t done for you?! Really?! My brother didn\u2019t understand why my mom didn\u2019t just call and say she was coming to visit. I told him that you have to INVITE her! A lot of people won\u2019t be pushy or wait to be invited. It\u2019s called manners. It\u2019s everyone else\u2019s fault but yours. They didn\u2019t do this and they didn\u2019t do that. I love how you say you have autism so we should keep that in mind when judging you since you have no empathy. I know and love many people with varying levels of autism. Most are kind and not outwardly hurtful. Yet you are completely conniving and purposely left his family out, including his grandparents!! How sad for your fianc\u00e9 and your child!

I know every person is different but if she's this high functioning to be engaged and a parent, she can have empathy. I've worked in mental health for decades and yes, lower functioning autistic people have difficulty being empathetic. However, in my experience working with this population, and being a mother to an adult Asperger's daughter, most that are high functioning (like OP is) are able to show empathy. My daughter can.\n\nI'm not even sure why she mentioned that but it does sound like she's using her autism as an excuse. She was very concise in explaining why she didn't invite them. I think it's more likely that she's just pissed that they haven't been more involved with her daughter (and I get that) but it seems like she added that edit once she started getting a bunch of YTAs.", "Why would he assume she was going to invite people who his wife and daughter barely know and who have shown zero interest in their daughter? She did invite his family member that has made an attempt to be in the child's life, and she doesn't even know the others.

Maybe you struggle to place yourself in other people\u2019s shoes, but are you even trying? Second, if you\u2019re organizing a party, it\u2019s on you to invite anyone who you and your partner want to attend. You should have asked him who he wanted at the party, gotten their contact info, and called or sent out invitations. It\u2019s 100% your place, and your job when you\u2019re planning a party, to do this. Third, this whole \u201chis family, my family\u201d attitude isn\u2019t gonna work when you\u2019re married.

It's not just about who has kids or who has visited.  Your husband needs to feel that his family is considered in his (& yours) child's big moments.  It says a lot to your husband that you've been planning this for so long but only 4 days before party say, you can invite family because I didn't & oops, even if you do invite them I didn't budget for them.  BTW, you have to figure out the details for them too.  What you just said is, I don't think your family is important.  Whether or not they attend is besides the point.  Your husband needs to know you value him and his family.  You also don't need to empathize.  You need to communicate.  Hubby, I'm planning the party.  This is what I was thinking, our moms helped us with some of the planning but I don't know who you want there, so let me know who & how to reach them  Also let me know if you want anything specific.  You don't need to feel what he feels but remember that hubby should have same input as you in family decisions.  Maybe the closest you will get to empathy might be to think if you would be upset if the tables were turned, even if those thoughts aren't instinctual.  Once you see that he's upset ask him why & how the situation can be solved, why he feels whatever he's feeling.  The more you ask him about the things that get him angry or frustrated, the easier it will be to recognize actions/situations that trigger his emotions and in turn, it will become easier for you to navigate.", "Yup. I'm autistic and VERY empathetic. The myth comes from what is called the empathy gap - we tend to assue other people think and feel like we ourselves do. Since autistic folk think and perceive so differently from non-autistic folk, we don't always understand or pick up on their reactions to things. It goes the same way back, studies have found, with non-autistic people being terrible at empathizing with autistic folks...", "Are you saying that you had a formal date, time and place booked when your daughter was 1 week old?
