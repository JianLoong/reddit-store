Is there any chance your friend likes you?", "NTA. I *hate* that people immediately think that their newly out friends are hitting on them. Then you have to explain that you aren't attracted to them and then they get insulted. There is no winning.\n\nThe truth is that not everyone is attractive to everybody and your \"friend\" seems uncomfortable with you now. Seems she is looking for a reason to make you the bad person in breaking up your friendship.", "NTA\n\nYou probably could have been gentler with your phrasing like \"I don't see you that way\" but I'm bi myself and have told friends I don't find them attractive before. She's the one who kept bringing it up.", "NTA, you are allowed to not be attracted to her. You picked up on the fact she may have been uncomfortable so told her you weren't attracted to her.", "NTA. Also bi here (31f). The majority of my friends and coworkers are attractive women, but I am not personally attracted TO them in that way. They are different things. I think your wording could have been kinder, but you were also just being honest. Hearing that someone isn't attracted to you is always going to sting, though. Her feelings are hurt....but you're also NTA.", "NTA. I feel like your delivery could be perceived as a tiny bit aggressive, but oh well. She shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. Her crying because of that is kinda wild imo.", "NTA I am a straight woman, but I\u2019m over everyone thinking bisexual individuals want to get with anyone and everyone, then get butt hurt when they find out their bisexual friends aren\u2019t actually after them. I\u2019m not attracted to every single man I meet, so in the same context, why would people think bisexuals want to get with every person they encounter? It just blows my mind how much crap my bisexual friends have to go though with this exact situation.", "wtf NTA. your friend is biphobic", "NTA. It\u2019s possible you came off a bit harsh in your tone, but I probably would have reacted the same way considering she kept bringing it up\u2014I would have been a bit annoyed/defensive.", "YTA. There's a gentle and compassionate way to tell someone you only see them as a friend only and a harsh mean way. \"Don't worry, I'm not attracted to you at all\" is pretty harsh. She probably took it as you thinking she's unattractive. You should apologize if you came off as harsh. And explain that you value her friendship, and sexualizing a friend is a place that you just don't allow yourself to go. And I totally get why she thought you were coming on to her. Holding hands, hugging, getting under a blanket together- all flirting moves. Keep your hands  to yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't harsh at all.  Good, you set her straight.  \n\nIf she has changed since she found out you were bisexual and behaved in this manner, what do you think of her now?  Will you remain friends or keep your distance after this interaction?", "YTA, but only in a \u201cthat came out wrong\u201d way. I think you totally meant well and your intentions were good when you said it, but the words themselves can really hurt if she\u2019s into you. It sounds like she wanted you to come on to her (unless I\u2019m really misreading the situation) and you didn\u2019t let her down as gently as you could have. Again, I could be completely misreading things. I would call her up and explain and just be very open and honest about everything. However, don\u2019t say you aren\u2019t attracted to her, just say you really love being friends and hanging out together and that your life would be suckier without her friendship. Good luck!", "YTA kinda. You could have asked for clarification before showing an attitude like that. We can\u2019t assume people\u2019s reasoning in their heads for the thing they said. We can judge if it\u2019s cool or not, but to know exactly what, we need to ask. But this is not like a destructive asshole behavior. You just need to communicate better that\u2019s all. You know what they say, hate the assholeness, not the asshole. \ud83d\ude4f", "[deleted]", "soft YTA. It's ok for you not to be attracted to her, but you could have been a bit more tactful with your response. A simple \"I only see you as a friend\" could have been way better. You likely didn't mean to hurt her feelings but the way you phrased it makes it seem like you were calling her unattractive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think she misunderstood\u2026.", "NTA. She probably started crying because you deflated her big ass head/ego", "NTA at all. There are two possibilities I think - that she was hoping for a different answer or that she is a little bit homophobic. If one of my (m) straight female or gay male friends said they weren't attracted to me I wouldn't be offended. Especially if I'd put them in a situation where they felt the need to say it (like your friend did)!", "I think she likes you, but is too shy to tell you. That's why she cried.", "NTA she only thought you were coming onto her after she found out you\u2019re bi when you guys were doing the same stuff you always do. Being attracted to women doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re attracted to ALL women.", "NTA there was nothing you could have done. She was convinced you were attracted to her and didn\u2019t like that, but telling her it wasn\u2019t true bruises her fragile ego. She would have been upset whatever you did. Your friend sounds slightly homophobic and narcissistic.", "YTA. Not because you wanted to make it clear that you weren\u2019t attracted to her, but because of how you said it.\n\nAs a woman I\u2019d assume you\u2019d understand that if someone said \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to you at all\u201d you\u2019d get incredibly offended. As a straight, married man, if a gay/bi man told me I wasn\u2019t remotely attracted it would hurt a bit. Not because I want them, but because being told you\u2019re attractive or not means something. Now, if they were a friend of mine and they said it, it would hurt more.\n\nYou have every right to be upset about her comments, but there\u2019s a polite way to go about discussing it. \nBetter way to say that: \u201chaha, you\u2019re pretty and all but I could never see you that way.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to make sure she stops (even if it may offend her) then something along the line of: \u201cIt\u2019s really bothering me that you have started assuming that just because I\u2019m bi our friendly playing around means I like you.\u201d It might lead to good conversation, it might start an argument, both are better than attacking.\n\nFinally, welcome to being the guy in a situation!", "None whatsoever - she\u2019s completely heterosexual. It\u2019s a bit hard to convey over text but when she asked if I was attracted to her, it was in an almost mildly scared/ disgusted sort of voice.", "Sounds like she wanted license to explore her feeling for OP", "Yes you misread. According to Op: \n\n>when she asked if I was attracted to her, it was in an almost mildly scared/ disgusted sort of voice.", "Um yeah no all over this. She was being homophobic to begin with and acted disgusted at the thought of OP being attracted to her. NTA", "Are you the friend ?", "That really sucks, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s disappointing to have this happen when you\u2019re newly out, and unfortunately this is something that can happen a lot in friendships with hetero friends who don\u2019t know how to navigate your sexuality without making it about themselves. \n\nIf she was asking in that way, it was definitely offensive on her part and you had every right to shut it down as you did. As it\u2019s your close friend, it could be worth following up with a text explaining that you didn\u2019t intend to be harsh, but letting her know that it\u2019s upsetting for a newly out person to be treated differently by their friends, especially if nothing in your behavior has changed.", "She might have internalized homophobia. I don't think she would have cried if she didn't feel some kind of way about you. But, if she was saying it in a disgusted way, then NTA for sure. Yours was a totally understandable reaction to the situation.", "Sure"]}
