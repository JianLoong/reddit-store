Is there any chance your friend likes you?", "NTA. I *hate* that people immediately think that their newly out friends are hitting on them. Then you have to explain that you aren't attracted to them and then they get insulted. There is no winning.\n\nThe truth is that not everyone is attractive to everybody and your \"friend\" seems uncomfortable with you now. Seems she is looking for a reason to make you the bad person in breaking up your friendship.", "NTA\n\nYou probably could have been gentler with your phrasing like \"I don't see you that way\" but I'm bi myself and have told friends I don't find them attractive before. She's the one who kept bringing it up.", "NTA, you are allowed to not be attracted to her. You picked up on the fact she may have been uncomfortable so told her you weren't attracted to her.", "NTA. Also bi here (31f). The majority of my friends and coworkers are attractive women, but I am not personally attracted TO them in that way. They are different things. I think your wording could have been kinder, but you were also just being honest. Hearing that someone isn't attracted to you is always going to sting, though. Her feelings are hurt....but you're also NTA.", "NTA. I feel like your delivery could be perceived as a tiny bit aggressive, but oh well. She shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. Her crying because of that is kinda wild imo.", "NTA I am a straight woman, but I\u2019m over everyone thinking bisexual individuals want to get with anyone and everyone, then get butt hurt when they find out their bisexual friends aren\u2019t actually after them. I\u2019m not attracted to every single man I meet, so in the same context, why would people think bisexuals want to get with every person they encounter? It just blows my mind how much crap my bisexual friends have to go though with this exact situation.", "wtf NTA. your friend is biphobic", "NTA. It\u2019s possible you came off a bit harsh in your tone, but I probably would have reacted the same way considering she kept bringing it up\u2014I would have been a bit annoyed/defensive.", "YTA. There's a gentle and compassionate way to tell someone you only see them as a friend only and a harsh mean way. \"Don't worry, I'm not attracted to you at all\" is pretty harsh. She probably took it as you thinking she's unattractive. You should apologize if you came off as harsh. And explain that you value her friendship, and sexualizing a friend is a place that you just don't allow yourself to go. And I totally get why she thought you were coming on to her. Holding hands, hugging, getting under a blanket together- all flirting moves. Keep your hands  to yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't harsh at all.  Good, you set her straight.  \n\nIf she has changed since she found out you were bisexual and behaved in this manner, what do you think of her now?  Will you remain friends or keep your distance after this interaction?", "YTA, but only in a \u201cthat came out wrong\u201d way. I think you totally meant well and your intentions were good when you said it, but the words themselves can really hurt if she\u2019s into you. It sounds like she wanted you to come on to her (unless I\u2019m really misreading the situation) and you didn\u2019t let her down as gently as you could have. Again, I could be completely misreading things. I would call her up and explain and just be very open and honest about everything. However, don\u2019t say you aren\u2019t attracted to her, just say you really love being friends and hanging out together and that your life would be suckier without her friendship. Good luck!", "YTA kinda. You could have asked for clarification before showing an attitude like that. We can\u2019t assume people\u2019s reasoning in their heads for the thing they said. We can judge if it\u2019s cool or not, but to know exactly what, we need to ask. But this is not like a destructive asshole behavior. You just need to communicate better that\u2019s all. You know what they say, hate the assholeness, not the asshole. \ud83d\ude4f", "[deleted]", "soft YTA. It's ok for you not to be attracted to her, but you could have been a bit more tactful with your response. A simple \"I only see you as a friend\" could have been way better.

There are two possibilities I think - that she was hoping for a different answer or that she is a little bit homophobic.

Especially if I'd put them in a situation where they felt the need to say it (like your friend did)!", "I think she likes you, but is too shy to tell you. That's why she cried.", "NTA she only thought you were coming onto her after she found out you\u2019re bi when you guys were doing the same stuff you always do.

She was convinced you were attracted to her and didn\u2019t like that, but telling her it wasn\u2019t true bruises her fragile ego. She would have been upset whatever you did. Your friend sounds slightly homophobic and narcissistic.", "YTA. Not because you wanted to make it clear that you weren\u2019t attracted to her, but because of how you said it.\n\nAs a woman I\u2019d assume you\u2019d understand that if someone said \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to you at all\u201d you\u2019d get incredibly offended. As a straight, married man, if a gay/bi man told me I wasn\u2019t remotely attracted it would hurt a bit. Not because I want them, but because being told you\u2019re attractive or not means something. Now, if they were a friend of mine and they said it, it would hurt more.\n\nYou have every right to be upset about her comments, but there\u2019s a polite way to go about discussing it. \nBetter way to say that: \u201chaha, you\u2019re pretty and all but I could never see you that way.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to make sure she stops (even if it may offend her) then something along the line of: \u201cIt\u2019s really bothering me that you have started assuming that just because I\u2019m bi our friendly playing around means I like you.\u201d It might lead to good conversation, it might start an argument, both are better than attacking.\n\nFinally, welcome to being the guy in a situation!", "None whatsoever - she\u2019s completely heterosexual.

As it\u2019s your close friend, it could be worth following up with a text explaining that you didn\u2019t intend to be harsh, but letting her know that it\u2019s upsetting for a newly out person to be treated differently by their friends, especially if nothing in your behavior has changed.", "She might have internalized homophobia. I don't think she would have cried if she didn't feel some kind of way about you. But, if she was saying it in a disgusted way, then NTA for sure. Yours was a totally understandable reaction to the situation.", "Sure", "NTA. She repeatedly asked if you were hitting on her and you finally answered the question. Your friend hurt her own feelings. Let her cry. \n\nIts frustrating when you come out to your friends and they immediately assume you have a crush on them because your attracted to women. Then they become offended when you aren\u2019t attracted to them as if it\u2019s a personal slight. You\u2019re response conveyed your irritation, but it was warranted given her behavior. \n\nI\u2019m a lesbian and have had to deal with this behavior a few times.

And how dare you have such evil&gross thoughts towards her? Is she even safe with you around?). Damned if you don't (how dare you not find them attractive? Are you calling them ugly?). Straight dudes with views like your friend here, will immediately focus on how your sexuality benefits them. And for them that's usually how fast they can plan a threesome. \n\nThis is not a battle that you're likely to win. But do try working things out with her. Like asking her if she's into every dude in her circles. If she's not lusting after every guy around her, why should you be? That is if she's coming from a place of ignorance. Or telling her that you only see her as a sister/friend. \n\nYou should however prepare yourself to deal with the fact that your friend might be homophobic and this might permanently change your relationship.\n\n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "NTA \n\nYou hurt her ego nothing you said was wrong.

I'd let her know just ow much her comments hurt and why when things have calmed down. If she can't handle it, then she shouldn't be your friend.", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like your friend may be a homophobe. She didn't have this attitude before you came out to her so why now?

What happened is not your fault at all, and if she's really concerned about it, at least she has her answer on the subject. I feel your pain, this is why I keep it to myself too. I hope you and your friend can come to an understanding.", "NTA but consider this: the friend may be confronting some feelings about her own sexuality, especially since learning of yours. If she hasn't encountered bisexuality before then it may have made her realise that it's an option for herself, as well as making her examine her feelings about her past behaviour with you.\n\nMaybe she is attracted to you, and was pushing this point to try to explore her feelings on her relationship with you and on her own sexuality (not necessarily trying to get with you).\n\nIf she isn't normally an emotional person like that, I'd say that this feels very possible to me. I'd suggest having an open conversation with her about it, you can tell her that you're feeling hurt by her making those comments and why, and try to get her to explain her thoughts behind making them.

Speaking as a not-straight person, this is so incredibly frustrating and exhausting. It becomes tedious when your friends of the same gender act like that constantly and make repetitive (extremely) un-funny \"jokes\" like that. If you're still friends, i highly suggest sitting her down and having a serious conversation with her about that and telling her that that is really crappy behaviour", "NTA. it's ridiculous that people assume just because someone is bi, it means that they're suddenly attracted to everyone in their life. no, it works generally in the same way. if you're straight and you're not into literally every person, it doesn't make sense to me that they would assume this. guess what bi people can do that too. they can also view people platonically, despite being attracted to multiple genders. they can also hang out with their friends without thinking of them sexually the whole time. \n\nsounds like she has a little homophobia, maybe some feelings she needed to work out on her own but instead forced you to help her process by confronting you based on HER internal assumptions about the situation. from your perspective, nothing changed. from her perspective, suddenly her friend could have been really into her this whole time! suddenly the fact that you are attracted to her gender becomes the most important thing about you. she fucked around and found out.", "NTA. Ugh your \"friend\" is full of herself. Does she go around assuming every straight guy is trying to fuck her? If yes then she's got issues which isn't your problem. If not then she's biphobic which still isn't your problem. Sorry you got a shit friend.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm bi and I hate this shit.
